<h3 class="p6">PREFACE.</h3>
<hr class="l15" />

<p>The story of the Captain of the Janizaries originated,
not in the author's desire to write a book, but in the
fascinating interest of the times and characters he has
attempted to depict. It seems strange that the world
should have so generally forgotten George Castriot,
or Scanderbeg, as the Turks named him, whose career
was as romantic as it was significant in the history of
the Eastern Mediterranean. Gibbon assigns to him but
a few brief pages, just enough to make us wonder that
he did not write more of the man who, he confessed,
"with unequal arms resisted twenty-three years the
powers of the Ottoman Empire." Creasy, in his history
of the Turks, devotes less than a page to the exploits
of one who "possessed strength and activity such as
rarely fall to the lot of man," "humbled the pride of
Amurath and baffled the skill and power of his successor
Mahomet." History, as we make it in events,
is an ever-widening river, but, as remembered, it is
like a stream bursting eastward from the Lebanons,
growing less as it flows until it is drained away in the
desert.</p>

<p>Though our story is in the form of romance, it is
more than "founded upon fact." The details are drawn
from historical records, such as the chronicles of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
monk Barletius&mdash;a contemporary, though perhaps a
prejudiced admirer, of Scanderbeg&mdash;the later Byzantine
annals, the customs of the Albanian people, and scenes
observed while travelling in the East.</p>

<p>The author takes the occasion of the publication of
a new edition to gratefully acknowledge many letters
from scholars, as well as notices from the press, which
have expressed appreciation of this attempt to revive
popular interest in lands and peoples that are to reappear
in the drama of the Ottoman expulsion from Europe,
upon which the curtain is now rising.

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>rom the centre of the old town of Brousa, in
Asia Minor&mdash;old even at the time of our story,
about the middle of the fifteenth century&mdash;rises an
immense plateau of rock, crowned with the fortress
whose battlements and towers cut their clear outlines
high against the sky. An officer of noble rank in the
Ottoman service stood leaning upon the parapet,
apparently regaling himself with the marvellous panorama
of natural beauty and historic interest which
lay before him. The vast plain, undulating down to
the distant sea of Marmora, was mottled with fields
of grain, gardens enclosed in hedges of cactus,
orchards in which the light green of the fig-trees
blended with the duskier hues of the olive, and dense
forests of oak plumed with the light yellow blooms of
the chestnut. Here and there writhed the heavy
vapors of the hot sulphurous streams springing out of
the base of the Phrygian Olympus, which reared its
snow-clad peak seven thousand feet above. The
lower stones of the fortress of Brousa were the mementoes
of twenty centuries which had drifted by them
since they were laid by the old Phrygian kings. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
flags of many empires had floated from those walls,
not the least significant of which was that of the Ottoman,
who, a hundred years before, had consecrated
Brousa as his capital by burying in yonder mausoleum
the body of Othman, the founder of the Ottoman
dynasty of the Sultans.</p>

<p>But the Turkish officer was thinking of neither the
beauty of the scene nor the historic impressiveness
of the place. His face, shaded by the folds of his
enormous turban, wore deeper shadows which were
flung upon it from within. He was talking to himself.</p>

<p>"The Padishah<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> has a nobler capital now than this,&mdash;across
the sea there in Christian Europe. But by
whose hands was it conquered? By Christian hands!
by Janizaries! renegades! Ay, this hand!"&mdash;he
stripped his arm bare to the shoulder and looked upon
its gnarled muscles as he hissed the words through
his teeth&mdash;"this hand has cut a wider swathe through
the enemies of the Ottoman than any other man's; a
swathe down which the Padishah can walk without
tripping his feet. And this was a Christian's hand
once! Well may I believe the story my old nurse
so often told me,&mdash;that, when the priest was dropping
the water of baptism upon my baby brow, this hand
seized the sacred vessel, and it fell shattered upon
the pavement. Ah, well have I fulfilled that omen!"</p>

<p>The man walked to and fro on the platform with
quick and jarring step, as if to shake off the grip of
unwelcome thoughts. There was a majesty in his
mien which did not need the play of his partially suppressed
fury to fascinate the attention of any who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
might have beheld him at the moment. He was tall
of stature, immensely broad at the shoulders, deep
lunged, comparatively light and trim in the loins, as
the close drawn sash beneath the embroidered jacket
revealed: arms long; hands large. He looked as if
he might wrestle with a bear without a weapon. His
features were not less notable than his form. His
forehead was high and square, with such fulness
at the corners as to leave two cross valleys in the
middle. Deep-set eyes gleamed from beneath broad
and heavy brows. The lips were firm, as if they had
grown rigid from the habit of concealing, rather than
expressing, thought, except in the briefest words of
authority,&mdash;Cæsar-lips to summarize a campaign in a
sentence. The chin was heavy, and would have
unduly protruded were it not that there were needed
bulk and strength to stand as the base of such prominent
upper features. Altogether his face would have
been pronounced hard and forbidding, had it not been
relieved as remarkably by that strange radiance with
which strong intelligence and greatness of soul sometimes
transfigure the coarsest features.</p>

<p>These peculiarities of the man were observed and
commented upon by two officers who were sitting in
the embrasure of the parapet at the farther end of the
battlement. The elder of the two, who had grown
gray in the service, addressed his comrade, a young
man, though wearing the insignia of rank equal to
that of the other.</p>

<p>"Yes, Bashaw,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> he is not only the right hand of the
Padishah, but the army has not seen an abler soldier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
since the Ottoman entered Europe. You know his
history?"</p>

<p>"Only as every one knows it, for in recent years he
has written it with his cimeter flashing through battle
dust as the lightning through clouds," replied the
young officer.</p>

<p>The veteran warmed with enthusiasm as he narrated,
"I well remember him as a lad when he was
brought from the Arnaout's<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> country. He was not
over nine years of age when Sultan Mahomet conquered
the lands of Epirus, where our general's
father, John Castriot, was duke. As a hostage young
George Castriot was brought with his three brothers
to Adrianople."</p>

<p>"Are his brothers of the same metal?" asked the
listener.</p>

<p>"Allah only knows what they would have been had
not state necessity&mdash;&mdash;" The narrator completed
the sentence by a significant gesture, imitating the
swirl of the executioner's sword as he takes off the
head of an offender.</p>

<p>"But George Castriot was a favorite of the Sultan,
who fondled him as the Roman Hadrian did his beautiful
page, Antinous. And well he might, for a lad
more lithe of limb and of wit never walked the ground
since Allah bade the angels worship the goodly
form of Adam.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Once when a prize was offered for
the best display of armor, and the provinces were
represented by their different champions in novel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
helmets and corselets and shields, none of which
pleased the imperial taste, it was the whim of the
Padishah to have young Castriot parade before the
judges panoplied only in his naked muscle, and to
order that the prize should be given to him, together
with the title Iscanderbeg.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> And well he won it.
In the after wrestling matches he put upon his hip the
best of them, Turcomans from Asia, and Moors from
Africa, and Giaours<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> from the West. And he was as
skilful on a horse's legs as he was on his own. His
namesake, Alexander, could not have managed Bucephalus
better than he. I well remember his game
with the two Scythians. They came from far to have
a joust with the best of the Padishah's court. They
were to fight singly: if one were overthrown, the
other, after the victor had breathed himself, was to
redeem the honor of his comrade. Scanderbeg sent
his spear-head into the throat of his antagonist at the
first encounter, when the second barbarian villain
treacherously set upon him from the rear. The young
champion wheeled his horse as quickly as a Dervish
twists his body, and with one blow of his sword,
clove him in twain from skull to saddle."</p>

<p>"Bravo!" cried the listener, "I believe it, for look
at the arm that he has uncovered now."</p>

<p>"It is a custom he has," continued the narrator.
"He always fights with his sword-arm bared to the
shoulder. When he was scarce nineteen years old he
was at the siege of Constantinople, in 800 of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Hegira,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> with Sultan Amurath. His skill there won
him a Sanjak.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Since that time you know his career."</p>

<p>"Ay! his squadrons have shaken the world."</p>

<p>"He has changed of late, however; grown heavy
at the brows. But he comes this way."</p>

<p>As the general approached, the two bashaws bowed
low to the ground, and then stood in the attitude of
profound obeisance until he addressed them. His
face gleamed with frank and genial familiarity as he
exchanged with them a few words; but it was again
masked in sombre thoughtfulness as he passed on.</p>

<p>Near the gate by which the fortress was entered
from the lower town was gathered a group of soldiers
who were bantering a strange looking creature with
hands tied behind him&mdash;evidently some captive.</p>

<p>"What have you here?" said Scanderbeg, approaching
them.</p>

<p>"That we cannot tell. It is a secret," replied the
subaltern officer in charge of the squad, making a low
salâm, and with a twinkle in his eyes which took from
his reply all semblance of disrespect.</p>

<p>"But I must have your secret," said the general
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"It is not our secret, Sire," replied the man, "but
his. He will not tell us who he is."</p>

<p>"Where does he belong? What tongue has he,
Aladdin? You who were once interpreter to the Bey
of Anatolia should know any man by his tongue."</p>

<p>"He has no tongue, Sire. He is dumb as a toad.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
His beard has gone untrimmed so long that it has
sewed fast his jaws. He has not performed his
ablutions since the last shower washed him, and his ears
are so filled with dirt plugs that he could not hear a
thunder clap."</p>

<p>The face of the captive seemed to strangely interest
the general, who said as he turned away, "Send him to
our quarters. The Padishah has taken a fancy to deaf
mutes of late. They overhear no secrets and tell no
tales. We will scrape him deep enough to find if he
has a soul. If he knows his foot from his buttocks he
will be as valued a present to His Majesty as a fifth
wife.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Send him to our quarters."</p>

<p>The general soon returned to the fortress. A room
dimly lighted through two narrow windows that
opened into a small inner court, and contained a divan
or couch, a table, and a motley collection of arms, was
the residence of the commandant. A soldier stood by
the entrance guarding the unfortunate captive.</p>

<p>"You may leave him with me," said Scanderbeg
approaching.</p>

<p>The man was thrust into the apartment, and stood
with head bowed until the guard withdrew. The general
turned quickly upon him as soon as they were
alone.</p>

<p>"If I mistake not, man, though your tongue be
tied, your eye spake to me by the gate."</p>

<p>"It was heaven's blessing upon my errand reflected
there," replied the man in the Albanian language. "I
bear thee a message from Moses Goleme, of Lower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Dibria, and from all the provinces of Albania, from
every valley and every heart."</p>

<p>"Let me hear it, for I love the very flints on the
mountains and every pebble on the shore of old Albania,"
replied Scanderbeg eagerly.</p>

<p>"Heaven be praised! Were my ears dull as the
stones they would open to hear such words," said the
man with suppressed emotion. "For since the death
of thy noble father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My father's death! I had not heard it. When?"
exclaimed the general.</p>

<p>"It is four moons since we buried him beneath the
holy stones of the church at Croia, and the Sultan sent
us General Sebaly to govern in his stead."</p>

<p>"Do you speak true?" cried Scanderbeg, laying his
hand upon the man's shoulder and glaring into his
face. "My father dead? and a stranger appointed in
his stead? and Sultan Amurath has not even told me!
Beware, man, lest you mistake."</p>

<p>"I cannot mistake, Sire, for these hands closed the
eyes of John Castriot after he had breathed a prayer
for his land and for his son&mdash;one prayer for both.
Moses Goleme was with us, for you know he was thy
father's dearest friend and wisest counsellor, and to
him thy father gave charge that word should be sent
thee that to thee he bequeathed his lands."</p>

<p>"Stop! Stop!" said Scanderbeg, pacing the little
room like a caged lion. "Let me think. But go on.
He did not curse me, then? Swear to me,"&mdash;and he
turned facing the man&mdash;"swear to me that my father
did not curse me with his dying breath! Swear it!"</p>

<p>"I swear it," said the man, "and that all Albania
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
prays to-day for George Castriot. These are the tidings
which the noble Moses bade me bring thee,
though I found thee at the Indus or under the throne
of the Sultan himself. I have no other message.
That I might tell thee this in the free speech
of Albania I have kept dumb to all others. If
it be treason to the Sultan for thee to hear it, let
my head pay the penalty. But know, Sire, that our
land will rest under no other rule than that of a
Castriot."</p>

<p>"A Castriot!" soliloquized the general. "Well, it
is a better name than Scanderbeg. Ho, guard! Take
this fellow! Let him share your mess!"</p>

<p>When alone the general threw himself upon the
divan for a moment, then paced again the apartment,
and muttered to himself&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And for what has a Castriot given himself to the
Turk! Yet I did not betray my land and myself.
They stole me. They seduced my judgment as a
child. They flattered my conceit as a man. Like a
leopard I have fought in the Padishah's arena, and for a
leopard's pay&mdash;the meat that makes him strong, and
the gilded cage that sets off his spots. I have led his
armies, for what? For glory. But whose glory? The
Padishah cries in every emergency, 'Where is <i>my</i>
Scanderbeg? Scanderbeg to the rescue!' But it
means, 'Slave, do my bidding!' And I, the tinselled
slave, bow my head to the neck of my steed, and the
empire rings with the tramp of my squadrons, and the
praise of Scanderbeg's loyalty! Pshaw! He calls me
his lightning, but he is honored as the invisible Jove
who hurls it. And I am a Castriot! A Christian! Ay,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
a Christian dog,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> indeed, to fawn and lick the hands
of one who would despise me were he not afraid of
my teeth. He takes my father's lands and gives them
to another; and I&mdash;I am of too little account to be
even told 'Thy father is dead.'"</p>

<p>Scanderbeg paused in the light that streamed
through the western window. It was near sunset, and a
ruddy gleam shot across the room.</p>

<p>"This light comes from the direction of Albania,
and so there comes a red gleam&mdash;blood red&mdash;from
Albania into my soul."</p>

<p>He drew the sleeve of the left arm and gazed at a
small round spot tattooed just above the elbow&mdash;the
indelible mark of the Janizary.</p>

<p>"They that put it there said that by it I should
remember my vow to the Padishah. And, since I cannot
get thee out, my little talisman, I swear by thee
that I shall never forget my vow; no, nor them that
made my child-lips take it, and taught me to abjure
my father's name, my country's faith, and broke my
will to the bit and rein of their caprice. It may be
that some day I shall wash thee out in damned
Moslem blood. But hold! that would be treason.
Scanderbeg a traitor? How they will hiss it from
Brousa to Adrianople; from the lips of Vizier and pot-carrier!
But is it treason to betray treason? But
patience! Bide thy time, Castriot!"</p>

<p>A slight commotion in the court drew the attention
of Scanderbeg. In a moment the sentry announced:</p>

<p>"A courier from His Majesty!"</p>

<p>The message told that the Ottoman forces had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
defeated in Europe&mdash;the noted bashaw, Schehadeddin,
having been utterly routed by Hunyades. The missive
called the Sultan's "always liege and invincible servant,
Scanderbeg, to the rescue!" Within an hour a
splendid suite of officers, mounted on swift and gaily
caparisoned steeds, gathered about the great general,
and at the raising of the horse-tail upon the spear-head,
dashed along the road to the coast of Marmora
where vessels were in waiting to convey them across to
the European side. Scanderbeg had but a moment's
interview with the dumb captive, sufficient to whisper,</p>

<p>"Return our salutation to the noble Moses Goleme;
and say that George Castriot will honor his confidence
better in deeds than he could in words. I know not
the future, my brave fellow, and might not tell it if I
did, even to ears as deaf as yours. But say to Goleme
that Castriot swears by his beard&mdash;by the beard of
Moses&mdash;that brighter days shall come for Albania even
if they must be flashed from our swords. Farewell!"</p>

<p>The man fell at the general's feet and embraced
them. Then rising he raised his hand, "By the beard
of Moses! Let that be the watchword between our
people and our rightful prince. Brave men scattered
from Adria to Hæmus will listen for that watchword.
Farewell, Sire. By the beard of Moses!"</p>

<p>Scanderbeg summoned a soldier and said sternly,
"Take this fellow away. He is daft as well as dumb
and deaf. Yet treat him well. Such creatures are
the special care of Allah. Take him to the Bosphorus
that he may cross over to his kin, the Greeks,
at Constantinople."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> little hamlet lay, like an eagle's nest, high on
the southern slope of the Balkan mountains.
The half dozen huts of which it consisted were made
of rough stones, daubed within and without thick with
clay. The roofs were of logs, overlaid with mats of
brushwood woven together by flexible withes, and
plastered heavily. The inhabitants were goatherds.
Their lives were simple. If they were denied indulgence
in luxuries, they were also removed from that
contact with them which excites desire, and so
were contented. They seldom saw the faces of any
from the great world, upon so large a portion of which
they looked down. Their absorbing occupation was
in summer to watch the flocks which strolled far away
among the cliffs, and in winter to keep them close to
the hamlet, for then terrific storms swept the mountains
and filled the ravines with impassable snow.</p>

<p>Milosch and his good wife, Helena&mdash;Maika Helena,
good Mother Helena, all the hamlet called her&mdash;were
blessed with two boys. Their faces were as bright as
the sky in which, from their lofty lodgings, they might
be said to have made their morning ablutions for the
eleven and twelve years of their respective lives. Yet
they were not children of the cherubic type; rather
tough little knots of humanity, with big bullet-heads
thatched over with heavy growths of hair, which
would have been red, had it not been bleached to a
light yellow by sunshine and cloud-mists. Instead of
the toys and indolent pastimes of the nursery they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
only the steep rocks, the thick copse, the gnarled
trees, and the wild game of the mountains for their
play-things. They thus developed compactly knit
muscles, depth of lung and thickness of frame, which
gave agility and endurance. At the same time, the
associations of their daily lives, the precipitous cliff,
the trembling edge of the avalanche, the caves of
strange beasts, the wild roaring of the winds, the
awful grandeur of the storms, the impressive solitude
which filled the intervals of their play like untranslatable
but mighty whispers from the unknown world
taking the place of the prattle of this,&mdash;these fostered
intrepidity, self-reliance, and balance of disposition,
if not of character. For religious discipline they had
the occasional ministrations of a Greek priest or
missionary monk from the Rilo Monastir, many leagues
to the west of them. They knew the Creed of Nicæa,
the names of some of the saints; but of truly divine
things they had only such impressions as they caught
from the great vault of the universal temple above
them, and from the suggestions of living nature at
their feet.</p>

<p>By the side of Milosch's house ran&mdash;or rather
climbed and tumbled, so steep was it&mdash;that road over
the Balkans, through the Pass of Slatiza, by which
Alexander the Great, nearly two thousand years
before, had burst upon the Moesians. Again, within
their father's memory, Bajazet, the "Turkish Lightning"
as he was called because of the celerity of his
movements, had flashed his arms through this Pass,
and sent the bolts of death down upon Wallachia, and
poured terror even to the distant gates of Vienna.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Often had Milosch rehearsed the story of the terrible
days when he himself had been a soldier in the army
of the Wallachian Prince Myrtche; and showed the
scar of the cut he had received from the cimeter of a
Turkish Janizary, whom he slew not far from the site
of their home.</p>

<p>Their neighbor, Kabilovitsch, a man well weighted
with years, not only listened to these tales, but added
marvellous ones of his own; sometimes relating to the
wars of King Sigismund of Hungary, who, after Prince
Myrtche, had tried to regain this country from the
cruel rule of the Moslems; more frequently, however,
his stories were of exploits of anonymous heroes.
These were told with so much enthusiasm as to create
the belief that the narrator had himself been the actor
in most of them. For Kabilovitsch was a strange
character in the little settlement; though not the less
confided in because of the mystery of his previous life.
He had come to this out-of-the-way place, as he said,
to escape with his little daughter the incessant raids
and counter-raids of Turks and Christians, which kept
the adjacent country in alarm.</p>

<p>Good Uncle Kabilovitsch&mdash;as all the children of the
hamlet called him&mdash;named his daughter, a lass of ten
summers, Morsinia, after the famous peasant beauty,
Elizabeth Morsiney, who had so fascinated King
Sigismund.</p>

<p>Morsinia often braided her hair, and sat beneath
her canopy of blossoming laurel, while Constantine,
the younger of Milosch's boys, dismounted from the
back of his trained goat at the mimic threshold, and
wooed her on bended knee, as the good king wooed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
the beautiful peasant. Michael, the elder boy, was
not less ardent, though less poetic, in the display of
his passion for Morsinia. A necklace of bear's claws
cut with his own hand from a monster beast his
father had killed; a crown made of porcupine quills
which he had picked up among the rocks; anklets of
striped snake skin&mdash;these were the pledges of his love,
which he declared he would one day redeem with
those made of gems and gold&mdash;that is, when he should
have become a princely warrior.</p>

<p>To Constantine, however, the little maiden was
most gracious. It was a custom in the Balkan villages
for the young people, on the Monday after Easter, to
twist together bunches of evergreens, and for each
young swain to kiss through the loops the maid he
loved the best. With adults this was regarded as a
probationary agreement to marry. If the affection
were mutually as full flamed the following Easter, the
kiss through the loop was the formal betrothal.
Constantine's impatience wreathed the evergreens
almost daily, and, as every kiss stood for a year, there
was awaiting them&mdash;if the good fairies would only
make it true&mdash;some centuries of nuptial bliss.</p>

<p>The little lover had built for himself a booth
against the steep rocks. Into this Morsinia would
enter with bread and water, and placing them upon
the stone which answered for a table, say, in imitation
of older maidens assuming the care of husbands, "So
will I always and faithfully provide for thee." Then
she would touch the sides of the miniature house with
a twig, which she called her distaff, saying, "I will
weave for thee, my lord, goodly garments and gay."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
She would also sit down and undress and redress her
doll, which Constantine had carved from wood, and
which they said would do for the real baby that the
bride was expected to array, in the ceremony by which
she acknowledged the obligations of wifehood.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>But Michael was not at all disconsolate at this preference
shown his brother; for he knew that Morsinia
would prefer him to all the world when she heard
what a great soldier he had become. Indeed, on some
days Michael was lord of the little booth; and more
than once the fair enchantress put the evergreen loop
around both the boys in as sincere indecision as has
sometimes vexed older hearts than hers.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the winter of 1443&mdash;a few months subsequent to
the events with which our story begins&mdash;the Pass
of Slatiza echoed other sounds than the cry of the
eagle, the bleating of the flocks, and the songs and
halloos of the mountaineers. Distant bugle calls
floated between the cliffs. At night a fire would flash
from a peak, and be suddenly extinguished, as another
gleamed from a peak beyond. Strange men had gone
up and down the road. With one of these Uncle
Kabilovitsch had wandered off, and been absent several
days. Great was the excitement of the little folks
when Milosch told them that a real army was not far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
off, coming from the Christian country to the north of
them, and that its general was no other than the great
Hunyades, the White Knight of Wallachia&mdash;called so
because he wore white armor&mdash;the son of that same
King Sigismund and the fair Elizabeth Morsiney.
How little Morsinia's cheeks paled, while those
of the boys burned, and their eyes flashed, as
their father told them, by the fire-light in the centre
of their cabin, that the White Knight had already
conquered the Turks at Hermanstadt and at Vasag
and on the banks of the Morava, and was&mdash;if the story
which Milosch had heard from some scouts were true&mdash;preparing
to burst through the Balkan mountains, and
descend upon the homes of the Turk on the southern
plains. Little did they sleep at night, in the excitement
of the belief that, at any day, they might see the
soldiers&mdash;real soldiers, just like those of Alexander,
and those of Bajazet&mdash;tramping through the Pass.
The tremor of the earth, occasioned by some distant
landslide, in their excited imagination was thought
to be due to the tramp of a myriad feet. The hoot of
the owl became the trumpet call for the onset: and the
sharp whistle of the wind, between leafless trees and
along the ice-covered rocks, seemed like the whizzing
flight of the souls of the slain.</p>

<p>Once, just as the gray dawn appeared, Kabilovitsch,
who had been absent for several days, came hurriedly
with the alarming news that the Turks, steadily retiring
before the Christians, would soon occupy the
Pass. They were already coming up the defiles, as
the mists rise along the sides of the mountains, in
dense masses, hoping to gain such vantage ground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
that they could hurl the troops of Hunyades down
the almost perpendicular slopes before they could
effect a secure lodgment on the summit. The children
and women must leave herds and homes, and fly
instantly. The only safe retreat was the great cave,
which the mountaineers knew of, lying off towards the
other Pass, that of Soulourderbend.</p>

<p>The fugitives were scarcely gone when the mountain
swarmed with Moslems. The mighty mass of
humanity crowded the cliffs like bees preparing to
swarm. They fringed the breastworks of native rock
with abattis made of huge trunks of trees. During
the day the Turks had diverted a mountain stream, so
that, leaving its bed, it poured a thin sheet of water
over the steepest part of the road the Christians were
to ascend. This, freezing during the night, made a
wall of ice. The Christians were thus forced to leave
the highway and attempt to scale the crags far and
near; a movement which the Turks met by spreading
themselves everywhere above them. Upon ledges
and into crevices which had never before felt the
pressure of human feet clambered the contestants.
Every rock was empurpled with gore. Turkish turban
and Hungarian helmet were caught upon the same
thorny bush; while the heads which had worn them
rolled together in the same gully, and stared their
deathless hatred from their dead eyes.</p>

<p>The Turks in falling back discovered the mouth of
the cave in which the peasants had taken refuge. As
the Moslem bugles sounded the retreat, lest they
should be cut off by the Christians who had scaled
the heights on their flanks, they seized the women and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
children, who soon were lost to each other's sight in
the skurry of the retiring host. The hands of Constantine
were tied about the neck, and his legs about the
loins, of a huge Moslem, to whose keeping he had
been committed. An arrow pierced the soldier to the
heart.</p>

<p>It seemed as if more than keenness of eye&mdash;some
inspiration of his fatherly instinct&mdash;led Kabilovitsch
on through the vast confusion, far down the slope,
outrunning the fugitives and their pursuers, avoiding
contact with any one by leaping from rock to rock
and darting like a serpent through secret by-paths,
until he reached the horsemen of the Turks, who had
not been able to follow the foot-soldiers up the steep
ascent. He knew that his little girl would be given
in charge to some one of these. He, therefore, concealed
himself in the growing darkness behind a clump
of evergreen trees, close to which one must pass in
order to reach the horses. A moment later, with the
stealth and the strength of a panther, he leaped upon
a Turk. The man let go the tiny form of the girl
he was carrying; but, before he could assume an
attitude of defence, the iron grip of Kabilovitsch was
upon his throat, and the steel of the infuriated old
man in his heart. Under the sheltering darkness,
carrying his rescued child, Kabilovitsch threaded
his way along ledges and balconies of rock projecting
so slightly from the precipitous mountain that they
would have been discerned, even in daylight, by no
eye less expert than his own. At one place his way
was blocked by a dead body which had fallen from the
ledge above, and been caught by the tangled limbs of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
the mountain laurel. Without relinquishing his load,
he pushed with his foot the lifeless mass down through
the entanglement, and listened to the snapping of the
bushes and the crashing of loosened stones, until the
heavy thud announced that it had found a resting
place.</p>

<p>"So God rest his soul, be he Christian or Paynim!"
muttered the old man. "And now, my child, are you
frighted?"</p>

<p>"No, father, not when you are with me," said Morsinia.</p>

<p>"Could you stand close to the rock, and hold very
tight to the bush, if I leave you a moment?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father, I will hold to the bush as tight as it
holds to the rock."</p>

<p>Kabilovitsch grasped a root of laurel, and, testing
it with main strength, swung clear of the ledge, until
his foot rested upon another ledge nearly the length of
his body below. Bracing himself so that he spanned
the interval with the strength of a granite pillar, he
bade the child crawl cautiously in the direction of his
voice. As she touched his hands, he lifted her with
perfect poise, and placed her feet beside his own
on a broad table rock.</p>

<p>"Now, blessed be Jesu, we are safe! Did I not
tell you I would some day take you to a cavern which
no one but Milosch and I had ever seen? Here it is.
Unless Sultan Amurath hires the eagles to be his
spies&mdash;as they say he does&mdash;no eye but God's will see
us here even when the sun rises. You did not know,
my little princess, what a coward your old father had
become, to run away from a battle. Did you, my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
darling?" said he kissing her. "Never did I dream
that Ar&mdash;&mdash;, that Kabilovitsch would fly like a frightened
partridge through the bushes. But my girl's
heart has taken the place of my own to-night."</p>

<p>As he spoke he slipped from his shoulders the
rough cape, or armless jacket, of bear-skin, and wrapped
the girl closely in it. He then carried her beneath
the roof of a little cave, where he enfolded her in his
arms, making his own back a barrier against the cutting
night wind and the whirling snow. The cold was
intense. Thinking only of the danger to the already
half-benumbed and wearied body of the child, he took
off his conical cap, and unwound the many folds of
coarse woollen cloth of which it was made, and with it
wrapped her limbs and feet.</p>

<p>Thus the night was passed. With the first streak of
the dawn Kabilovitsch crept cautiously from the
ledge, and soon returned with the news that the Turks
had vanished, swept away by the tide of Christian
soldiers which was still pouring over and down the
mountain in pursuit.</p>

<p>Horrible was the scene which everywhere greeted
them as they clambered back toward the road. The
dead were piled upon the dying in every ravine. Red
streaks seamed the white snow&mdash;channels in which the
current of many a life had drained away. The road
was choked with the hurrying victors. But the old
man's familiarity with the ground found paths which
the nimble feet of the maid could climb; so that the
day was not far advanced when they stood on the site
of their home. Scarcely a trace of the little hamlet
remained. Whatever could be burned had fed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
camp-fires of the preceding night. The houses had
been thrown down by the soldiers in rifling the grain
bins which were built between their outer and inner
walls.</p>

<p>The old man sat down upon the door-stone of what
had been his home. His head dropped upon his
bosom. Morsinia stood by his side, her arm about his
neck, and her cheek pressed close to his, so that her
bright golden hair mingled with his gray beard&mdash;as
in certain mediæval pictures the artist expresses a
pleasing fancy in hammered work of silver and gold.
They scarcely noticed that a group of horsemen, more
gaily uniformed than the ordinary soldiers, had halted
and were looking at them.</p>

<p>"By the eleven thousand virgins of Coln! I never
saw a more unique picture than that," said one who
wore a skull cap of scarlet, while an attendant carried
his heavy helmet. "If Masaccio were with us I
would have him paint that scene for our new cathedral
at Milano, as an allegory of the captivity in Babylon."</p>

<p>"Rather of the captivity in Avignon. It would be
a capital representation of the Holy Father and his
daughter the Church," replied a companion laughing.
"Only I would have the painter insert the portrait of
your eminence, Cardinal Julian, as delivering them
both."</p>

<p>"That would not be altogether unhistoric; for the
deliverance was not wholly wrought until our time,"
replied the cardinal, evidently gratified with the flattering
addition which his comrade, King Vladislaus,
had made to his pleasing conceit. "But
if to-day's victory be as thorough as it now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
looks, and we drive the Turks out of Europe, it would
serve as a picture of the captivity in which the
haughty, half-infidel emperor of the Greeks and his
daughter, Byzantium, will soon be to Rome."</p>

<p>"But, by my crown," said Vladislaus, "and with due
reverence for the great cardinal under whose cap is
all the brain that Rome can now boast of&mdash;I think the
Greeks will find as much spiritual desolation in
Mother Church as these worthy people have about
them here."</p>

<p>"I can pardon that speech to the newly baptized
king of half-barbarian Hungary, when I would not
shrive another for it," replied Julian petulantly. "The
son of a pagan may be allowed much ignorance
regarding the mystery of the Holy See. But a truce
to our badgering! Let us speak to this old fellow.
Good man, is this your house? By Saint Catherine!
the girl is beautiful, your highness."</p>

<p>"It was my home, Sire, yesterday, but now it is his
that wants it," replied Kabilovitsch.</p>

<p>"And where do you go now?" asked the cardinal.</p>

<p>"Towards God's gate, Sire; and I wish I might see
it soon, but for this little one," said the old man,
rising.</p>

<p>"Holy Peter let you in when you get there,"
rejoined His Eminence, turning his horse away.</p>

<p>"Hold! Cardinal," replied the king. "I am surprised
at that speech from you. You have tried to
teach me by lectures for a fortnight past that Rome
has temporal as well as spiritual authority, all
power on earth as well as in heaven. Now, by Our
Lady! you ought to help this good man over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
his earthly way towards God's gate, as well as
wish him luck when he gets there. But the priest
preaches, and leaves the laity to do the duties of
religion. Credit me with a good Christian deed to
balance the many bad ones you remember against me,
Cardinal, and I will help the man. The golden hair
of the child against the old man's head were as good
an aureole as ever a saint wore. And that Holy Peter
knows, if the Cardinal does not. Ho, Olgard! Take
the lass on the saddle with you. And, old man, if you
will keep close with your daughter, you will find as good
provision behind the gate of Philippopolis as that in
heaven, if report be true. And, by Saint Michael!
if we go dashing down the mountain at this rate we
will vault the walls of that rich Moslem town as
easily as the devil jumped the gate of Paradise."</p>

<p>Kabilovitsch trudged by the side of Olgard, who
held Morsinia before him. It was hard for the old
man to keep from under the hoofs of the horses as
the attendant knights crowded together down the
narrow and tortuous descent. Suddenly the girl
uttered a cry, and, clapping her hands, called,</p>

<p>"Constantine, Constantine!"</p>

<p>The missing lad, emerging from a copse, stood for
an instant in amazement at the apparition of his little
playmate; then dashed among the crowd toward her.</p>

<p>"Drat the witch!" said a knight&mdash;between the
legs of whose horse the boy had gone&mdash;aiming at him
a blow with his iron mace. Constantine would have
been trampled by the crowding cavalcade, had not the
strong hand of a trooper seized him by his ragged
jacket and lifted him to the horse's crupper.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>"So may somebody save my own lad in the mountains
of Carpathia!" said the rough, but kindly
soldier.</p>

<p>"Ay, the angels will bear him up in their hands,
lest he even dash his foot against a stone, for thy
good deed," exclaimed a monk, who, with hood
thrown back, and almost breathless with the effort to
rescue the lad himself, had reached him at the same
moment.</p>

<p>"Good Father, pray for me!" said the trooper,
crossing himself.</p>

<p>"Ay, with grace," replied the monk, extricating
himself from the crowd, and hasting back to the side
of a wounded man, whom his comrades were carrying
on a stretcher which had been extemporized with an
old cloak tied securely between two stout saplings.</p>

<p>As night darkened down, the plain at the base of
the mountain burst into weird magnificence with a
thousand campfires. The Turks were in full retreat
toward Adrianople, and joy reigned among the
Christians. It was the eve of Christmas. The stars
shone with rare brilliancy through the cold clear
atmosphere.</p>

<p>"The very heavens return the salutation of our
beacons," said King Vladislaus.</p>

<p>A trumpet sounded its shrill and jubilant note,
which was caught up by others, until the woods and
fields and the mountain sides were flooded with the
inarticulate song, as quickly as the first note of a bird
awakens the whole matin chorus of the summer
time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p>Cardinal Julian, reining his horse at the entrance to
the camp, listened as he gazed&mdash;</p>

<p>"'And with the angel there was a multitude of the
heavenly host praising God!' Let us accept the joy
of this eve of the birth of our Lord as an omen of the
birth of Christian power to these lands, which have
so long lain in the shadow of Moslem infidelity and
Greek heresy. Our camps yonder flash as the sparks
which flew from the apron of the Infant Jesu and
terrified the devil.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Sultan Amurath has been scorched
this day, though the infernal fiend lodge in his skin,
as I verily believe he does."</p>

<p>"Amurath was not in personal command to-day.
At least so I am told," replied Vladislaus. "He is
occupied with a rebellion of the Caramanians in Asia.
Carambey, the Sultan's sister's husband, led the forces
at the beginning of the fight. He was captured in the
bog, and is now in safe custody with the Servian Despot,
George Brankovich. Hunyades and the Despot
have been bargaining for his possession. But the real
commandant, as I have learned from prisoners&mdash;at
least he was present at the beginning of the fight&mdash;was
Scanderbeg."</p>

<p>"Scanderbeg?" exclaimed Julian with great alarm.
"What! the Albanian traitor, Castriot?&mdash;Iscariot,
rather, should be his name&mdash;This then, Your Majesty,
is no night for revelry; but for watching. The
flight of the enemy, if Scanderbeg leads them, is only
to draw us into a net. What if before morning, with
the Balkans behind us, we should be assaulted with
fresh corps of Turks on the front? There is no fathoming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
the devices of Scanderbeg's wily brain. And
never yet has he been defeated, except to wrest the
better victory out of seeming disaster. Does General
Hunyades know the antagonist he is dealing with? that
it is not some bey or pasha, nor even the Sultan himself,
but Scanderbeg? I have heard Hunyades say
that since the days of Saladin, the Moslems have not
had a leader so skilful as that Albanian renegade: that
a glance of his eye has more sagacity in it than the
deliberations of a Divan:<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and that not a score of
knights could stand against his bare arm. We must
see Hunyades."</p>

<p>"I confess," replied King Vladislaus, "that I liked
not the easy victory we have had. I would have
sworn to prevent a myriad foes climbing the ice road
we travelled yesterday, if I had but a company of
pikemen; yet ten thousand Turkish veterans kept us
not back; and they were led by Scanderbeg! There
is mystery here. Jesu prevent it should be the mystery
of death to us all! Let's to Hunyades! If only
your wisdom or prayers, Cardinal, could reclaim Scanderbeg
to his Christian allegiance, I would not fear
Sultan Amurath, though he were the devil's pope,
with the keys of death and hell in his girdle."</p>

<p>Hunyades was found with the advance corps of the
Christians. But for his white armor he could scarcely
be distinguished from some subaltern officer, as he
moved among the men, inspecting the details of their
encampment. The contrast of the commander-in-chief
with the kingly and the ecclesiastical soldier was
striking. He listened quietly to their surmises and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
fears, and replied with as little of their excitement as
if he spoke of a new armor-cleaner:</p>

<p>"Yes! we shall probably have a raid from Scanderbeg
before morning. But we are ready for him.
Do you look well to the rear, King Vladislaus! And
do you, Cardinal, marshal a host of fresh Latin prayers
for the dying; for, if Scanderbeg gets among your
Italians, their saffron skins will bleach into ghosts for
fright of him."</p>

<p>The cardinal's face grew as red as his cap, as he
replied:</p>

<p>"But for loyalty to our common Christian cause,
and the example of subordination to our chief, I
would answer that taunt as it deserves."</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he company which Kabilovitsch and the children
had joined was halted at the edge of the great
camp. Other peasants and non-combatants crowded
in from their desolated homes; but neither Milosch's
face, nor Helena's, nor yet little Michael's, were among
those they anxiously scanned. The command of
King Vladislaus secured for the three favored refugees
every comfort which the rude soldiers could furnish.
The boy and girl were soon asleep by a fire, while the
old man lay close beside them, that no one could
approach without arousing him. He, however, could
not sleep. On the one side was the noisy revelry of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
the victors; on the other, the darkness of the plain.
Here and there were groups of soldiers, and beyond
them an occasional gleam of the spear-head of some
sentinel, who, saluting his comrade, turned at the end
of his beat.</p>

<p>The dusky form of a huge man attracted Kabilovitsch's
eye. As the stranger drew near, his long bear-skin
cape terminating above in a rough and ungraceful
hood, and his long pointed shoes with blocks of
wood for their soles, indicated that he was some
peasant. He seemed to be wandering about with no
other aim than to keep himself warm. Yet Kabilovitsch
noted that he lingered as he passed by the
various groups, as if to scan the faces of his fellow-sufferers.</p>

<p>"Heaven grant that all his kids be safe to-night!"
muttered the old man.</p>

<p>As the walking figure passed across the line of a
fagot fire, he revealed a splendid form; too straight
for one accustomed to bend at his daily toil.</p>

<p>"A mountaineer? a hunter?" thought Kabilovitsch,
"for the field-tillers are all round of shoulder, and
bow-backed. But no! His tread is too firm and
heavy for that sort of life. One's limbs are springy,
agile, who climbs the crags. A hunter will use the
toes more in stepping."</p>

<p>Kabilovitsch's curiosity could not keep his eyes
from growing heavy with the cold and the flicker of
the fire light, when they were forced wide open again
by the approach of the stranger. The old man felt,
rather than saw, that he was being closely studied
from behind the folds of the hood which the wanderer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
drew close over his face, to keep out the cutting wind
which swept in gusts down from the mountains. He
passed very near, and was talking to himself, as is
apt to be the custom of men who lead lonely
lives.</p>

<p>"It is bitter cold," he said, with chattering teeth,
"bitter cold, by the beard of Moses!"</p>

<p>The last words startled Kabilovitsch so that he gave
a sudden motion. The stranger noticed it and
paused. Gazing intently upon the old man, who had
now assumed a sitting posture, he addressed him&mdash;</p>

<p>"By the beard of Moses! it's an awful night,
neighbor."</p>

<p>"Ay, by the beard of Moses! it is; and one could
wear the beard of Aaron, too, with comfort&mdash;Aaron's
beard was longer than Moses' beard; is not that what
the priest says?" said Kabilovitsch, veiling his excitement
under forced indifference of manner, at the
same time making room for the visitor, who, without
ceremony stretched himself by his side, bringing his
face close to that of the old man, and glaring into it.
Kabilovitsch returned his gaze with equal sharpness.</p>

<p>"What know you of the beard of Moses?" said
the stranger. "Was it gray or black?"</p>

<p>"Black," said Kabilovitsch, studying the other's
face with suspicion and surprise. "Black as an
Albanian thunder cloud, and his eye was as
undimmed by age as that of the eagle that flies over
the lake of Ochrida."<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>"You speak well," replied the stranger, pushing
back his hood.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

<p>His face was massive and strong. No peasant was
he, but one born to command and accustomed to it.</p>

<p>"You are&mdash;&mdash;Drakul?" asked the man.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Harion?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Kabilovitsch?"</p>

<p>"Ay, and you?"</p>

<p>"Castriot."</p>

<p>Kabilovitsch sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Lie down! Lie down! Let me share your
blanket," said the visitor. "This air is too crisp and
resonant for us to speak aloud in it; and waking ears
at night-time are over quick to hear what does not
concern them. We can muffle our speech beneath
the blanket."</p>

<p>Kabilovitsch felt the hesitation of reverence in
assuming a proximity of such intimacy with his guest;
but also felt the authority of the command and the
wisdom of the precaution. He obeyed.</p>

<p>"I feared that I should find no one who recognized
our password. I must see General Hunyades to-night;
yet must not approach his quarters. Can you
get to his tent?"</p>

<p>"Readily," said Kabilovitsch. "During the day
my little lass yonder won the attention of King Vladislaus,
and he gave me the password of the camp
to-night for her safety. '<i>Christus natus est</i>'."</p>

<p>"You must go to him at once, and say that I would
see him here. You will trust me to keep guard over
these two kids while you are away? I will not wolf
them."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>"Heaven grant that you may shepherd all Albania,"&mdash;and
the old man was off.</p>

<p>"I knew that the prodigal Prince George would
come back some day," said he to himself. "Many a
year have I kept my watch in the Pass, and among the
mountains of Albania. And many a service have I
rendered as a simple goatherd which I could not
have done had I worn my country's colors anywhere
except in my heart. And, 'by the beard of Moses!'
During some weeks now I have carried many a message,
had some fighting and hard scratching which I
did not understand, except that it was 'by the beard
of Moses!' And now Moses has come; refused at
last to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, and
will free his people. God will it! And George Castriot
has lain under my blanket! I will hang that
blanket in the church at Croia as an offering to the
Holy Virgin.&mdash;But no, it belongs to the trooper.
Heaven keep me discreet, or, for the joy of it, I cannot
do my errand safely. I'll draw my hood close,
lest the moon yonder should guess my secret."</p>

<p>Kabilovitsch was challenged at every turn as he
wound between the hundreds of camp-fires and tents;
but the magic words, "Christus natus est," opened
the way.</p>

<p>A circle of splendid tents told him he drew near to
headquarters. In the midst of them blazed an
immense fire. Camp-tables, gleaming with tankards
and goblets of silver, were ranged beneath gorgeous
canopies of flaxen canvas, which were lined with blue
and purple tapestries. A multitude of gaily dressed
servitors thronged into and out of them. Here was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
royal splendor of Hungary and Poland; there the
pavilion of the Despot of Servia; there the glittering
cross of Rome; and, at the extreme end of this extemporized
array of palatial and courtly pride, the more
modest, but still rich, banner of the White Knight.</p>

<p>Kabilovitsch approached the latter.</p>

<p>"Your errand, man?" said the guard, holding his
spear across the flapping doorway of the tent.</p>

<p>"Christus natus est!" was the response.</p>

<p>"That will do elsewhere, but not here," rejoined the
guard.</p>

<p>"My business is solely with General Hunyades," said
Kabilovitsch.</p>

<p>"It cannot be," said the spearman. "He has no
business with any one but himself. If you are a shepherd
of Bethlehem come to adore the Infant Jesu&mdash;as
you look to be&mdash;you must wait until the morning."</p>

<p>"My message is as important to him as that of the
angels on that blessed night," said the goatherd, making
a deep obeisance and looking up to heaven as if
in prayer, as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Then proclaim your message, old crook-staff! we
have had glad tidings to-day, but can endure to hear
more," said the guard, pushing him away.</p>

<p>"No ear on earth shall hear mine but the general's,"
cried the old man, raising his voice: "No! by the
beard of Moses! it shall not."</p>

<p>"A strange swear that, old leather-skin! Did you
keep your sheep in Midian, where Moses did, that you
know he had a beard. Your cloak is ragged enough
to have belonged to father Jethro; and I warrant it is
as full of vermin as were those of the Egyptians after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
the plague that Moses sent on them. But the ten
plagues take you! Get away!"</p>

<p>"No, by the beard of Moses!" shouted Kabilovitsch.</p>

<p>"Let him pass!" said a voice from deep within the
tent.</p>

<p>"Let him pass!" said another nearer.</p>

<p>"Let him pass!" repeated one just inside the outer
curtain.</p>

<p>The goatherd passed between a line of sentinels,
closely watched by each. The tent was a double one,
composing a room or pavilion, enclosed by the great
tent; so that there was a large space around the private
apartment of the general, allowing the sentinels
to patrol entirely about it without passing into the
outer air.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the inner tent Hunyades
appeared. He was of light build but compactly knit,
with ample forehead and generous, but scarred face;
which, however, was more significantly seamed with
the lines that denote thought and courage. He was
wrapped in a loose robe of costly furs. He waved his
hand for Kabilovitsch to enter, and bade the guards
retire. Throwing himself on a plain soldier's couch,
he drew close to it a camp seat, and motioned his
visitor to sit.</p>

<p>"You have news from the Albanians, by the beard
of Moses?" said Hunyades inquiringly.</p>

<p>A moment or two sufficed for the delivery of Kabilovitsch's
message.</p>

<p>"Ho, guard! when this old man goes, let no one
enter until he comes back; then admit him without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
the pass, instantly," said Hunyades, springing from
the couch. "Now, old man, give me your bear skin&mdash;now
your shoes&mdash;your cap. Here, wrap yourself in
mine. You need not shrink from occupying
Hunyades' skin for a while, since you have had
to-night a more princely soldier under your blanket.
Did you say to the north? On the edge of the camp?
A boy and a girl by the fire; and he?"</p>

<p>The disguised general passed out.</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">"B</span>y the beard of Moses! I'll break your head with
my stick if you come stumbling over me in that
way," growled Scanderbeg from beneath his blanket,
as a peasant-clad man tripped against his huge form
extended by the camp fire.</p>

<p>"Then let the cold shrink your hulk to its proper
size," replied the stranger. "But you should thank
me, instead of cursing me, for waking you up; for
your fire is dying out, and you would perish, sleeping
in the blanket that exposes your feet that it may cover
your nose. But I'll stir your fire and put some sticks
on it, if I may sit by it and melt the frost from my
beard and the aches from my toes. But whom have
you here?"</p>

<p>The man stooped down and eagerly removed the
blanket from the partially covered faces of the
children.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>"Constantine!" he exclaimed, "God be praised!
and Kabilovitsch's girl,&mdash;or the starlight mocks me!"</p>

<p>"Father!" cried the boy, waking and throwing his
arms about the neck of the man who stooped to
embrace him.</p>

<p>"And Michael? is he here, too?" asked Milosch.</p>

<p>"No, father," said the child. "We were parted at
the cave, and I have not seen him except in my
dream."</p>

<p>"In your dream, my child? In your dream?
Jesu grant he be not killed, that his angel spirit came
to you in your dream! Did he seem bright and
beautiful&mdash;more beautiful than you ever saw him
before&mdash;as if he had come to you from Paradise?
No? Then he is living yet on the earth; and by all
the devils in hell and Adrianople! I shall find him,
though I tear him from the dead arms of the traitor
Castriot himself, as I was near to taking you, my boy,
from the grip of the Turk whose heart I pierced with
an arrow the day of the fight;&mdash;but I was set upon
and nigh killed myself by a score of the Infidels."</p>

<p>"And our mother dear?" asked Constantine. "She
is safe?"</p>

<p>"Ay! ay! safe in heaven, I fear, but we will not
give up hope until we have searched our camps
to-morrow; nor then, until we have burned every
seraglio of the Turks from the mountains to the sea.
But who brought you and the lass here?" asked
Milosch, eyeing the form of the surly man beside him.</p>

<p>"Why, good Uncle Kabilovitsch did," said the boy,
staring in amazement at the spot now usurped by the
strange figure of Scanderbeg.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p>"Kabilovitsch went to fetch some fire-peat from
the gully I told him of," muttered Scanderbeg.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is coming yonder," said Milosch, as
Kabilovitsch's well-known hood and cape were outlined
against the white background of a snow-covered
fir tree a short distance off. "But he has found no fuel.
Wrap close, my hearties: you will have no more blaze
to-night. Ha! Kabilovitsch!" said he, raising his voice,
as the familiar form seemed about to pass by. "Has
the fire in your eye been put out by the cold, that you
cannot find your own place, neighbor? I would have
sworn that, if Kabilovitsch were blind, he could find a
lost kid on the mountains; and now he hardly knows
his own nest."</p>

<p>The assumed Kabilovitsch came near, and gave an
awkward salute, which, while intended to be familiar,
was not sufficiently unlimbered of the habit of authority
to avoid giving the impression that its familiarity was
only assumed.</p>

<p>"By the beard of Moses! I had almost mistook
my own camp, now the fires are smouldering," said
he, approaching.</p>

<p>"He is not Kabilovitsch," said Milosch, half to
himself and half aloud.</p>

<p>"No," replied Scanderbeg. "But I'll go and find
Kabilovitsch. Perhaps he has more peat than he can
carry. And, stranger, I'll help you find what you are
seeking&mdash;for you seem daft with the cold&mdash;if you will
help me find him I am to look for. By the beard of
Moses! that's a fair agreement; is it not?"</p>

<p>"A strange swear, that!" said Milosch, looking
after the two forms vanishing among the fir trees. "It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
is some watchword, and I like it not among these
camp prowlers. I fear for Kabilovitsch. The newcomer
wore his clothes, which I would know if I saw
them on the back of the cardinal; for good Helena
cut the hood for our neighbor as she cut the skirt for
his motherless child, little Morsinia there. Some mischief
is brewing. I shall watch and not sleep a
wink."</p>

<p>Had one been lurking in the copse of evergreens to
which the men withdrew, he would have overheard
conversation of which these sentences are parts.</p>

<p>"Yes, General Hunyades, the time has come. I
can endure the service of the Sultan no longer. But
for what I am about to do I alone am responsible, and
must decline to share that responsibility with any
other, either Moslem or Christian. I believe, Sire, that
I am in this directed by some higher power than my
own caprice. I am compelled to it by invisible forces,
as really as the stars are dragged by them through the
sky yonder."</p>

<p>"No star," replied Hunyades, "has purer lustre
than that of your noble purpose, and none are led by
the invisible forces to a brighter destiny than is Scanderbeg."</p>

<p>"Let not your Christian lips call me Scanderbeg,
but Castriot," said his companion. "Yes, I believe that
my new purpose comes from the inbreathing of some
celestial spirit, from some mysterious hearing the soul
has of the inarticulate voice of God. Else why should
the thought of it so strangely satisfy me? I cast myself
down from the highest pinnacle of honor and
power and riches with which the Moslem service can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
reward one;&mdash;for I am at the head of the army, and
even the Vizier has not more respect at Adrianople
than have I wherever the soldiers of the Sultan spread
themselves throughout the world. To leave the
Padishah will be to leave every thing for an uncertain
future. Yet I am more than content to do it."</p>

<p>"Not for an uncertain future, noble Castriot,"
replied Hunyades warmly, grasping his hand. "The
highest position in the armies of Christian Europe is
yours. My own chieftaincy I could demit without
regret, knowing that it would fall into your hands.
The army of Italy you can take command of to-morrow
if you will; for that scarlet-knobbed coxcomb of
an ecclesiastic, Julian, is not fitted for it. Or Brankovitch,
the Servian Despot, will hail you as chief
voivode.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> You have but to choose from our armies,
and put yourself at the head of whatever nation you
will: for the legions will follow the pointing of your
invincible sword as bravely as if it were the sword of
Michael, the Archangel."</p>

<p>"No! No! These things tempt me not," said
Scanderbeg. "I must live only for Albania. That
strange spirit which counsels me comes into my soul
like a pure blast from off my Albanian hills. The
voices that call me are like the dying voice of my
father, the sainted Duke John, who prayed then for
his land and for his son&mdash;for both in the one breath
that floated his soul to God. Let me look again upon
the rocky fastnesses of the Vitzi, the waters of little
Ochrida and Skidar, and call them mine; I shall then
not envy even the plume on your helmet, generous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Hunyades; nor regret what I forsake among the
Moslems, though my estate were that of the entire
empire which the Padishah sees in his dreams, when,
not the city of Adrian, but the city of Constantine
shall have become his capital."</p>

<p>"Christendom will hardly forgive the slight you put
upon it, noble Castriot, by declining some general command,
and will soon grow jealous of your exclusive
devotion to little Albania," said Hunyades, with evident
candor.</p>

<p>"Christendom will not lose, but gain, thereby,"
replied Scanderbeg. "For is not Albania, after all, a
key point in the mighty battle which is still to be
waged with the Turk over these Eastern countries of
Europe, from Adria to the Euxine?"</p>

<p>"How so?" asked Hunyades. "Have we not this
day broken the power of the Turk in Europe? and is
he not now in headlong haste to the sea of Marmora?"</p>

<p>Scanderbeg replied with slow, but ominous, words:</p>

<p>"General Hunyades, the Moslem power was not this
day broken. Trust not the semblance. My arm could
have hurled your soldiers down the northern declivities
of yonder mountains with as much ease as yours
shattered the Turkish ranks at Vasag and Hermannstadt.
The armies still in front of you wait but the
word to assail your camp with dire vengeance for their
mysterious defeat&mdash;ay, mysterious to them. And the
Padishah is hasting with the hordes released by his
victories over the Caramanians, to join them. No,
Sire, the battle for empire on these plains, and in Macedonia,
and along the Danube, has not ended: it has
but just begun. And Albania will be the key spot for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
a generation to come. No Ottoman wave can strike
central Europe but over the Albanian hills. A Christian
power entrenched there will be a counter menace
to every invasion from the side of the Moslem, and a
tremendous auxiliary in any movement from the side
of Christendom. My military judgment concurs with
the voice of that spirit which speaks within me, and
bids me as a Christian to live for Albania."</p>

<p>"I see in your plan," replied Hunyades, "a gleam
of that far wisdom that won for you the title of 'The
eye of the Ottoman,' as your valor made you the
'right hand of the Sultan.' While my view of the relative
power of the two civilizations now fronting each
other on our battle-lines might be different from yours,
and I should place the key point in the great field rather
on the lower Danube than so far to the west, I yet
submit my judgment to yours. Assign to me my part
in the affair you would execute, and, my word as a
soldier and a Christian, you shall have my help."</p>

<p>"Nay," replied Scanderbeg. "As I said, I can
share the responsibility of my action with no one.
Grave charges will ring against my name. My old
comrades will scorn my deed as treacherous. Even
history will fail to understand me. Let me act alone;
obeying that strange voice which will justify me, if not
before men, at least at the last day of the world's judgment.
The Moslem has wronged me; outraged my
humanity; slit the tongue of my conscience that it
should not speak to me of my duty; and tried to put
out the eyes of my faith. The Divinity bids me avenge
myself. But the vengeance is only mine, and God's.
No other hand must be stained with the blood of it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
least of all thine, noble Hunyades. My plan must be
all my own. I only ask that, when I have extricated
myself from Moslem ties, I may have the friendship of
Hunyades. Especially that the way may be left open
for my passing through the places now held by your
troops, without challenge and delay. All else has
been arranged by a handful of faithful Albanian
patriots."</p>

<p>"It shall be as you desire, General Castriot. Choose
your password, and it shall open the way for you
though it were through the back door of the Vatican."</p>

<p>"Let then the 'beard of Moses' be respected. My
trusty Albanians are accustomed to it."</p>

<p>"Good!" replied Hunyades. "And I will seal our
compact by taking Adrianople in honor of the departure
of its only defender."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Scanderbeg. "It will not be wise to
press upon the capital. Every approach is guarded
more securely than were those at Vienna by the Christians.
The Padishah's engineers are more skilful than
any in the land of the Frank or German. The new compound
of saltpetre and sulphur, of which you hardly
know the use, is buried beneath every gate; and
a spark will burst it as Ætna or Vesuvius.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Even
the valor of the White Knight cannot conquer the
soulless element. The black grains never blanch with
fear. No panic can divert a stone ball hurled from
cannon so that it shall not find the heart of the bravest.
I advise that your armies pause awhile with the prestige
of having scaled the Balkans. In a few months
opportunities may have ripened. Once I am in Albania,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Sultan Amurath shall know that the name of Scanderbeg&mdash;the
Lord Alexander&mdash;was not his, but Fate's entitling;
for, unless my destiny is misread, the Macedonian legions
of the Great Alexander were not swifter than my
new Macedonian braves shall be. This will encourage
the Venetians and Genoese; and with their navies on
the Hellespont, the timid Palælogus pressing out from
his covert of Constantinople, and insurrection everywhere
from the Crimea to Peloponnesus, there will
not, a generation hence, be left a turban in Europe.
Believe me, General, the Turk's grip of nearly a century,
since he pinched the continent at Gallipoli, cannot
be loosened in a day."</p>

<p>"To no other than Castriot would I yield my judgment;
and not to him, but that his words are as convincing
as his sword. Then so let it be," was the
reply of the Christian leader.</p>

<p>The Albanian disappeared.</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>unyades, closely muffled in his bear-skin disguise,
returned to the camp.</p>

<p>"A desperate adventure that of Castriot," thought
he. "It is well that he permits no voice but his own
to speak his plans, and no ear but mine to hear
them.</p>

<p>"Hist!</p>

<p>"No; it is but the ice crackling from the balsams.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Yet who knows what interlopers there may have been?
and if the brave Scanderbeg may not be hamstrung
before he reaches his own camp? The ride will be
long and rattling after he enters the Turkish lines.
Will it excite no suspicion? Nor his absence? Heaven
guard the brave heart, for the very mole holes in the
ground are the Sultan's ears, into which he drinks the
secrets of his soldiers. By the way, I must lift the
dirty cap from the fellow who called me Kabilovitsch at
the herdsman's fire; for the messenger who brought me
word surely said that only Castriot and the two children
were there. Who may this other one be? I must
discover; and if he knows aught he should not, he
shall know no more this side of hell-gate, or my dagger's
point has grown so honest that it has forgotten
the way to a knave's heart."</p>

<p>Approaching the little group, Hunyades went
behind them, that, if possible, he might overhear some
words before any persons there knew of his presence.</p>

<p>Milosch had been ill at ease through the continued
absence of his friend Kabilovitsch, the peculiar action
of the strange man who had taken his place beneath
the blanket, and the apparition of the one who wore the
cap and cape which he thought he could not mistake.
There had always been a mystery about Kabilovitsch's
early life, which their long and close neighborly relations
upon the mountain had not enabled him to solve.
The girl, he often thought, was of too light a
build and too fair featured to be the child of the mountaineer.
The story Kabilovitsch often told about the
early death of the child's mother, Milosch's wife
never heard without impatience and a shrug
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
of the shoulders. Who was the child? Could there
be any plot to carry her away among persons who
knew the secret of her birth? Milosch could reach
one definite conclusion about the matter, and that was
that he ought to guard the child just now. So, with
senses made alert by suspicion, he heard the soft footfall
of Hunyades through the crust-broken snow; and
though with head averted, noted his stealthy approach.
The caution observed by the stranger made Milosch
feel certain of the intended treachery. Loosening the
short sheath-knife, which hung by the ring in its bone
handle from his girdle, he grasped it tightly, and with
a sudden bound faced the intruder.</p>

<p>"Your business, man?" said he, eyeing him as a
hunter eyes a wolf to anticipate the spring of the
brute, that the knife may enter his throat before the
fangs strike.</p>

<p>"A rude greeting to a neighbor, that," was the
quiet reply.</p>

<p>"A fair enough greeting to one who wears a neighbor's
fleece, and prowls by night about his flock.
Stop! not a step nearer! or, by the soul of Kabilovitsch,
whom, for aught I know, you have murdered,
I will send you to meet him!"</p>

<p>A motion of the stranger toward his weapon was
anticipated by the mountaineer, who gripped the intruder
with the strength of a bear, pinioning his arms
by his sides, and falling with him to the ground. In
an instant more, however, the dagger point of his
antagonist began to penetrate Milosch's thigh.
Clenching tighter to prevent a more deadly thrust, he
felt beneath his opponent's rough outer robe the hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
corselet woven with links of iron&mdash;not the coarse
fabric such as was worn by common soldiers, but the
lighter steel-tempered underwear of knights and
nobles.</p>

<p>"You have murdered another better than yourself,
damned villain, and have stolen his shirt. But it shall
not save you this time."</p>

<p>As he let out these words one by one and breath by
breath, Milosch worked the knife into such a hold that
he could press it into the back of his antagonist.
Slowly but surely the stout point made its way between
the hard links until the man's flesh quivered with
the pain. Then Milosch hissed through his clenched
teeth:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who are you? If you speak not, you die. If you
lie, let the devil shrive your black soul! for I'll send
you to him on the knife point. Speak!"</p>

<p>"I am General Hunyades," replied the almost
breathless man.</p>

<p>The words relieved him from the pressure of the
knife, but not from the crunching hug of his captor.</p>

<p>"Prove it!" hissed Milosch. "I have heard that
Hunyades has a scar on the left side of the neck.
Uncover your neck!"</p>

<p>Milosch released Hunyades' left hand sufficiently
to allow him to reach upward. In an instant the
leathern string which bound the bear-skin cape about
his neck was broken, the lacings of a velvet jacket
loosened, and the fingers of Milosch led over the
roughened surface of the scarred skin.</p>

<p>The herdsman rose to his knees, and kissed the
hand of the general.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>"Strike thy dagger into me! for I have raised my
hand against the Lord's anointed," cried he in shame
and fear.</p>

<p>"Nay, friend," said the chief; "the fault was mine,
and yours shall be the reward of the only man who
ever conquered Hunyades. Your name, my good
fellow?"</p>

<p>"Milosch!"</p>

<p>"Milosch, the goatherd of the Pass? I have heard
tell of your strength; how you could out-crunch a
bear; I believe it. You have been faithful to your
absent friend, as you have been severe with me."</p>

<p>"But what of my friend Kabilovitsch? You surely
wear his gear," said Milosch.</p>

<p>"Yes, I borrowed these of a passing stranger&mdash;I
know not that he be Kabilovitsch&mdash;with which I might
pass disguised among the guards. The owner of this
cape and hood is keeping warm in a tent hard by until
I return. But whom have you here?"</p>

<p>"The lad is mine. The lass is my neighbor's. He
calls her Morsinia, in honor of your fair mother,"
replied Milosch.</p>

<p>"Then I must see her face. She should be fair
with such a name."</p>

<p>As he raised the coarse-knit hood which closely
wrapped her, a flicker of the dying fire-light
illumined for an instant the features of the child.
The uncombed mass of golden hair made a natural
pillow in which lay a face unsurpassed in balance of
proportion and delicacy of detail by any sculptor's art.
Her forehead was high and full, but apparently diminished
by the wealth of curling locks that nestled upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
brow and temples; her nose straight and thin, typically
Greek; her lips firm, but arched, as with some
abiding and happy dream; her skin, purest white,
tinged with the glow of youthful health, as the snow
on the Balkans under the first roseate gleam of the
morning sun.</p>

<p>"A peasant's child?" asked the general. But without
waiting for reply, continued, "No, by the cheek of
Venus! It took more than one generation of noble
culture, high thoughts and purest blood, to mould
such a face as that. She was not born in your neighbor's
cot on the mountains? Will you swear that she
was? No? Then I will swear that she was not.
And the boy? Ah!" said he, scanning Constantine's
face. "I know his stock. He is a sprig of the same
rough thorn-tree that came near to tearing me to
pieces just now. But his face is gentler than yours.
Yet, it is a strong one; very bold; broad-thoughted;
deep-souled; a sprig that may bear even better fruit
than the old one."</p>

<p>"Heaven grant it may!" said Milosch, fervently.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you will let me transplant it from these
barren mountains to the gardens of Buda and the
banks of the Drave, it will get better shelter than you
can give it. The boy shall be my protégé for to-night's
adventure, if his father will enter my personal service.
You see, you gave me so warm a welcome that I am
loath to part company with you, my good fellow."</p>

<p>"Heaven bless you, Sire!" replied Milosch; "but
my heart will cling to these cliffs until I know that my
faithful wife and other boy are no longer among them."</p>

<p>"I shall give orders that the camp be searched,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
promised Hunyades. "If they live, and have not
been carried away by the Turks, they must have
sought refuge somewhere in the host. Farewell!
When you will, Hunyades shall stand the friend of
Milosch."</p>

<p>The apparent old herdsman returned through the
heart of the camp to headquarters.</p>

<p>"Methinks, comrade, that you bandied words with
a greater than you knew, when you teased the old
goatherd awhile ago," said a sentinel, thrusting his
thumb into the side of the spearman at the entrance to
the general's hut. "Do you note his mien as he comes
yonder? That crumpled old bear skin cannot hide
his straight back; nor those shoes, as big as Spanish
galleons, break the firmness of his tread. If the gust
of wind should lift his cape you would see at least a
golden cross on his shoulders. You cannot hide a
true soldier."</p>

<p>The bear-skin passed between the fluttering canvas
without challenge. Hunyades made a playful salute
to Kabilovitsch, who rose to meet him.</p>

<p>"I found your camp. I have looked into the face
of your little daughter."</p>

<p>"Mary save her!" said the old man with gratified look.</p>

<p>"I say I saw your daughter, your <i>daughter</i>, you
know," said the general again, quizzing Kabilovitsch
with his eyes.</p>

<p>"Ay, my daughter! and the Virgin Mother never
sent a fairer child, save Jesu himself, to prince or
peasant."</p>

<p>"Come, now," said the general, "tell me, did the
Holy Virgin send this child to prince <i>or</i> peasant?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>"Why?" said Kabilovitsch, "these horny hands
should tell thee, Sire, that I was not royal
born."</p>

<p>"But the girl may be, if you were not. Is she your
child?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my child, if heaven ever sent one to man."</p>

<p>"But, tell me," probed the general, "how did
heaven send you the maiden? Did the mother bring
her, or did the angels drop her at your door? For,
if that girl be your child, heaven did not know you
even by sight; since it put not a freckle of your dark
skin upon her fair face, nor one of your bristles into
her hair. The stars are not begotten of storm-clouds;
nor do I think she is your daughter."</p>

<p>To this the old man replied, more to himself than
to his interrogator, "If she is not mine by gift of
nature, she is mine by gift of Him who is above
nature."</p>

<p>"I will not steal your secret," said Hunyades.
"Her name has excited my interest in her and her
heaven-given or heaven-lent father. She needs better
protection than you can give her in the camp. I will
send her to headquarters."</p>

<p>"I would gratefully put her under your protection
for a few days," said Kabilovitsch. "My duty takes
me away from her for a while; dangerous duty, Sire,
and if I should fall&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If Kabilovitsch falls, Hunyades will be as true
father to the lass. Have you any special desire regarding
her or yourself, my brave man? You have
but to name it."</p>

<p>"But one, Sire," replied Kabilovitsch. "That I may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
see her safely conditioned at once. For it may be that
before the day dawns I shall be summoned. I serve a
cause as mysterious as the Providence which watches
over it."</p>

<p>"An Albanian mystery? They are generally as
inscrutable as a thunder cloud; but are revealed when
its lightning strikes!" replied Hunyades, dismissing
the old man, accompanied by two guards, who were
commissioned to obey implicitly any orders the herdsman
might give regarding the party of refugees by his
camp-fire.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Christian host prolonged the festival of the
Nativity from day to day, until the mustering
forces of the Ottomans summoned them from dangerous
inactivity again to the march and the battle. The
latter they found at Mount Cunobizza, where the
enemy had massed an enormous force. The Christian
army, with its splendid corps of Hungary, Poland,
Bosnia, Servia, Wallachia, Italy and Germany, was
not a more magnificent array than that of their Moslem
opponents. For the most part of the day the
field was equally held, but in the afternoon the
Turkish left seemed to have become inspired with a
strange fury. The Janizaries, at the time renowned
as the best disciplined and most desperate foot-soldiers
in the world, were rivalled in celerity and
intrepidity, in skilful man&oelig;uvring and the tremendous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
momentum with which they struck the foe, by other
Moslem corps; such as the squadrons of cavalry collected
from distant military provinces, each under its
Spahi or fief-holder; and the irregular Bashi-Bazouks,
who seemed to have sprung from the ground in
orderly array. Their diverse accoutrements, complexions,
and movements suggested the hundred arms of
some martial Briareus, all animated by a single brain.
The war cry of "The Prophet!" was mingled with
that of "Iscanderbeg!" In the thickest of the fight
appeared the gigantic form of the circumcised Albanian,
his gaudy armor flashing with jewels,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> his right
arm bared to the shoulder, his cimeter glancing as
the lightning. The Italian legions opposite him, upon
the Christian left, were hurled back again and again
from their onslaught, and were pressed mile after mile
from the original battle site. Hunyades inflicted a
compensatory punishment upon the Moslem left,
shattering its depleted ranks as a battering ram
crashes through the tottering walls of a citadel. The
chief of the Christians saw clearly Scanderbeg's plan<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
to leave the victory in his hands, and at the opportune
moment he wheeled his squadrons to the assistance
of King Vladislaus, thus combining in overwhelming
odds against the enemy's centre, which Scanderbeg had
effectually drained of its proper strength. As soon,
however, as it was evident that the Christians were
the victors, Scanderbeg, by superb generalship, interposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
the Janizaries between the enemy and the turbaned
heads that, but for this, were being whirled
in full flight from the field. The rout was changed
into orderly retreat. Hunyades found it impossible to
press the pursuit, and muttered,</p>

<p>"Scanderbeg commands both our armies to-day.
We can only take what he is minded to give."</p>

<p>At length night looked down upon the camps. Few
tents were erected. Hunyades sat for hours beneath
a tree, waiting for he knew not what developments.
On the Turkish side even the Beyler Beys, the highest
commanders, were content to stretch their limbs with
no other canopy than the three horse-tails at the
spear-head, the symbol of their rank and authority.
Far in the rear were the few pavilions of the suite of
the Grand Vizier, who represented the absent Sultan
Amurath. Late into the night the Vizier sat in
counsel with the Sultan's Reis Effendi or chief secretary,
to whom was entrusted the seal of the empire.
He was enstamping the many despatches which fleetest
horsemen carried to distant Spahis, summoning them
with their reserves to rally for the defence of Adrianople.</p>

<p>Just before the dawn the secretary was left alone.
Even he, and, in his person, the empire, must catch
an hour's sleep before the exciting and exacting
duties of the new day. He reclined among his papers.
But a summons awakened him: the messenger
announcing Scanderbeg. The guards withdrew to a
respectful distance from the outside of the tent.</p>

<p>"Do not rise," said the general, gently pressing the
secretary back to his reclining posture. "I only need
the imperial seal to this order."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p>The secretary scanned the paper with incredulous
eyes. It was a firman, or decree of the Sultan, passing
the government of Albania from General Sebaly to
Scanderbeg, with absolute powers, and ordering the
commandant of the strong fortress of Croia to place
all its armament and that of adjacent strongholds in
Scanderbeg's hand as the viceroy of the Sultan. As
the secretary lifted his face to utter an inquiry for
the relief of his amazement, knowing that the Sultan,
then absent in Asia, could not have ordered such a
document, the strong hand of Scanderbeg gripped his
throat, and his poniard threatened his heart.</p>

<p>"The mark!" whispered the assailant.</p>

<p>The terrified man tremblingly reached the seal, and
pressed it against the wax. The weapon then did its
work, and so suddenly that the secretary had no time
for even an outcry. Then silently, so that the guards,
who were but a few paces distant, heard no commotion,
he laid the lifeless form on the divan, and covered
it with the embroidered cloak it had worn when
living.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Passing out, Scanderbeg gave orders that the tent
should not be entered by the guards until morning, that
the secretary might rest. He gave the password, "The
Kaaba," as sharply as if his lips would take vengeance
on the once sacred, but now hated sound. His military
staff joined him at a little distance. Vaulting
into the saddle he led the way toward the north. At
the edge of the camp by a rude bridge he halted, and
said to his attendants,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>"I meet at this point the Beyler Bey of Anatolia,
whose staff will be my escort to his camp. The
Padishah's cause needs closest conference of all the
commanders; for treason is abroad. Ah! I hear the
escort. Return to quarters, gentlemen!"</p>

<p>Riding forward alone in the direction of the noise,
he cried, "Who comes?"</p>

<p>"The Kaaba at Mecca," was the response.</p>

<p>"Well, if the Kaaba takes the trouble to come to
me it is a good omen, by the beard of Moses!"</p>

<p>"By the beard of Moses!" murmured a group of
horsemen, bowing their turbaned heads in the first
gray light of the approaching day. The cavalcade
closed around the fugitive chieftain, and moved along
in silence, except to respond to the sentinels. As they
passed the extreme picket of the Turks they halted.
A wardrobe had been secreted in a cave beyond a
copse near the road. Dismounting, the men
exchanged their turbans for caps of wolf or
beaver skin. Their gaily trimmed jackets, such as
were worn by the Turkish foot-soldiers, gave place to
short fur sacks. Their flowing, bag-bottomed trousers
were kicked off, leaving abbreviated breeches of
leather. In a few moments the splendidly uniformed
suite of a Moslem bey was transformed into a rough,
but exceedingly unique-looking, band of Albanian
guerillas. Scanderbeg assumed a helmet, the summit
of which carried as a device the head and shoulders
of a goat&mdash;since the times of Alexander the Great the
symbol of the powers in, or bordering upon, Macedonia.
The Turkish uniforms were bundled upon the
cruppers for future use.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p>The men stood for a moment, each by the side of
his horse. At a motion of the officer in charge they
gave the salute; touching their bared foreheads, and
bowing to the ground. The officer then approached
Scanderbeg, and, presenting his sword, said:</p>

<p>"Sire! to thee, as the son of our Duke John, we
give our swords together with our hearts and our
lives." Instantly every sword was laid upon the
ground; and the crisp air rattled with the cry, "Long
live Duke George! A Castriot forever!"</p>

<p>Scanderbeg gazed silently for a moment upon the
faithful group. There was no doubt of their loyalty:
for they had proved it by an adventure of rare daring
in penetrating the Turkish camp. The face of the
great general, usually masking so completely his
strongest feelings, lost now its rigidity. His eyes were
moist; his lips trembled; every lineament was eloquent
with the emotion he could neither conceal nor
tell in words. After a few moments' impressive
silence, he returned the sword to the officer, and, pointing
westward, cried,</p>

<p>"Forward to Albania!"</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">"T</span>hank Heaven! the plan did not fail," said the
chief officer, riding by the side of the fugitive
general.</p>

<p>"In no particular has it failed, Colonel," replied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Scanderbeg. "And for this every praise is due your
wise precautions. I have never known better work of
brain or nerve. With such grand soldiers as you and
your men, I fear nothing for Albania. But your name,
Colonel?"</p>

<p>"Moses Goleme," replied the officer courteously.</p>

<p>Scanderbeg reined his horse, and gave him his
hand heartily. "A man as grand as he is brave!
And do I really look into the face of him whom I was
to have sought out in Dibria, that I might tell him his
words had been to me like a voice from heaven?
Heaven reward you, good Moses! But you must vow
to stand by me yet as patiently as you have done
hitherto&mdash;during my apostasy. I shall need your
charity still; for I am but a returning prodigal; a
half-Christian; a man of strange ways; of a temper
which I understand not myself, and which will disappoint
you. Pledge me that you will be my good
angel. Counsel me frankly, fearlessly, as a man
should always counsel a man. Rebuke me freely:
but bear with me in your heart, as you would with a
child."</p>

<p>"I may not advise the most capable general in the
world," replied Moses Goleme. "I vow to obey.
Let that be my part. As I have already imperilled
my estates by open opposition to the Turkish rule,
and given my life to the liberty of my country, so I
offer all to thee, Sire, the sovereign of my heart, until
you shall be acknowledged the sovereign of Albania,
and a new empire be founded on the east of the
Adriatic which shall take the place of the decaying
powers of Italy on the west."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>"The task your patriotism proposes is vast," replied
Scanderbeg; "too vast for one man and one lifetime."</p>

<p>"Too great for any but the great Castriot!"
was the answer, evidently as honest as it was reverent.
"But you do me too much honor, General, in
praising my plan of meeting you. I was ably seconded
by my men, and especially by two of them. One of
them was wounded."</p>

<p>"I trust you speak not of a brave fellow who
brought me the time and place of the rendezvous:
for I never saw such strength and daring in my
life."</p>

<p>"The same, I fear," said Moses. "A Servian, whom
I had not known before yesterday. But he was boiling
over with rage for the slaughter of his family, and
commended to me by our most trusted scout."</p>

<p>"Did he tell you how he found me out, and communicated
your plan to me?"</p>

<p>"No, for he was too severely hurt to speak
much."</p>

<p>"I will tell that part for him, then," said Scanderbeg.
"It was in the hottest of the fight. My own
body-guard was thrown into confusion. A fellow,
clad like one of my own staff, crowded close to my
side. His horse actually rested against my own, and
I would have severed his head from his shoulders for
his impudent valor, had not his oath at his beast been
'by the beard of Moses!' Seeing that I observed it he
grunted, 'At the brook to the north!' as he dodged
the circles of the cimeters; and 'Near the Roman
road!' he hissed as he pared the cap from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Christian's head with his sword; and 'At the ninth
hour to-night!' he shouted as he parried a thrust.
Before I had breathing space&mdash;for I was closely beset
at the time&mdash;he had gone; borne back by a Spahi,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
who envied him his place and emulated his valor.
But he was not skilful in using his weapon or
managing his horse. I am grieved, but not surprised,
at his receiving hurt. I thought he must have fallen.
But who was the other?"</p>

<p>"Yonder old fellow with a huge green turban on
the saddle before him. If his brain were as big as his
head-piece, he could not have planned better. He
has dwelt about here lately."</p>

<p>"I must thank him in person," said Scanderbeg,
riding back toward him.</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed as the full daylight fell
upon the man's features, "Kabilovitsch?"</p>

<p>The old man diverted Scanderbeg's compliments by
an expression of solicitude for Milosch, whom he had
permitted to undertake the desperate venture already
narrated, although until a few days before he, being a
Servian, had no knowledge of the project of the
Albanians.</p>

<p>"We must haste, Sire," said Moses. "It is advised
that you cross to the north of the pass in the Balkans,
and take thence the valley way between Caratova and
the Egrisu. A message from General Hunyades
informs me that relays can be provided along the
road, and that every facility shall be given us."</p>

<p>"Kabilovitsch will accompany us?" asked Scanderbeg.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p>"On one condition, Sire," replied the old man.
"My little daughter must go with me: a lass of ten
spring tides&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Impossible! for our ride must be night and
day."</p>

<p>"Then I may follow, but cannot accompany you,"
said Kabilovitsch.</p>

<p>"I need such men as you with me. No true
Albanian will delay for a child. Country must be
child and mother to us all," said the general.</p>

<p>The cheeks of Kabilovitsch whitened; his eyes
flashed. Looking Scanderbeg squarely in the face, he
said quietly, but putting intention into every
word,</p>

<p>"George Castriot may lead, but may not rebuke
the patriots who have watched for Albania with sacrifices
he knows not of, while he has been among our
country's enemies. An old man, thy father's friend
before thou wast born, may say that, Sire."</p>

<p>Scanderbeg grew pale in turn. He had been unaccustomed
to brook insubordination, however righteous.
Who had dared to question him? Who to fling
the taunt into his face? The hot words were upon
his lips. But he paused, at first from the
mere habit of self-restraint. Then, because he was
a wise man, and realized that he was no longer the
tyrant, with power of life and death over his soldiers&mdash;men
who had been hired, stolen, impressed into the
service, and transformed into mere machinery of flesh
and blood&mdash;but was to be the public liberator of a people
every man of whom was already as free as he. Then,
he had become a just man. Strange and sanguinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
as had been the events accompanying his desertion of
the Turks, he had taken this step only after a deep
moral struggle. He had revolted from his own past
life; and felt an inward disgrace for what had been
his outward glory&mdash;the service of the Moslem; he
despised himself more than any other person could.
It was this sense of the justice of Kabilovitsch's
rebuke that checked the rage which had blanched his
face, and sent the flush to his temples, as he slowly,
replied, "I bow to the merited chastisement of your
words. Your years and your better life give you
license to utter them. My future shall atone for the
past. But cannot your child be left safely where she
is?"</p>

<p>"She is safe where she is; but I may not leave her
without providing for her future. Milosch is lying in
a cottage but a little before us. If his wounds are
not fatal&mdash;as I believe they are not, though the leech
thought otherwise&mdash;I may bring the girl to him, and
still overtake you before you come in sight of the
Black Mountains. I can cross this country by paths
through which I could not direct you. During many
years, for justice's sake and our country's, I have
wandered over these mountains where only the eagle's
shadow has fallen."</p>

<p>"I will stop with you at the cottage," said Scanderbeg,
"for, though the moments are precious, I would
bless the brave fellow for his work yesterday."</p>

<p>There were several wounded Christian soldiers at
the little hovel. A Greek monk was administering
both spiritual and physical comfort; for Rilo Monastir
had sent its inmates along the track of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
Christian army in spite of the insults of the Latin
soldiers, who, though in sight of the common enemy
of their faith, could not repress the meanness of their
sectarian jealousy and hatred. Milosch was doing
well. His wounds were, one in the fleshy part of the
shoulder, the other a contusion on the head, from a
blow which had stunned him. A few weeks would
put him again upon his feet, though perhaps his fighting
days were over; for the flesh wound lay across
an important muscle, and would permanently destroy
the strength of the right arm.</p>

<p>Milosch fell in with the proposition of Kabilovitsch
regarding Morsinia. Though a Servian, he had lost
interest in his own country because of the vacillating
course of the Despot, George Brankovitch, who was
half Christian and half Moslem, according to the policy
of the moment. Milosch would identify himself with
the cause of Albania, for which he had already done
and suffered so much.</p>

<p>The two men entered into what is known among
the Servians and Albanians as "Brotherhood in God,"
covenanting in the name of God and St. John to
devote their lives, each to the other, and both to their
common cause. The compact was sealed by each
putting the left hand upon the other's heart, and
holding up the right hand in invocation of the Divine
witness. Kabilovitsch said:</p>

<p>"My brother, I commit to thy keeping our daughter,
Morsinia, thine and mine, from henceforth. She is
all I have but life to share with thee, which also I
freely give."</p>

<p>To this Milosch replied:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>"My brother, I commit to thy keeping our boy,
Constantine, thine and mine from henceforth. He is
all I have that I wot of to share with thee, but my life
which&mdash;God spare it&mdash;I freely give."</p>

<p>"Bismallah!"<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> said Scanderbeg. "And if the
girl and the boy were the ones I saw asleep in each
other's arms by the fire the other night, the compact
is good for two generations at least."</p>

<p>It was agreed that, upon his sufficient recovery,
Milosch should bring the children from the camp of
Hunyades to Albania.</p>

<p>The ride by the Vitosh and Rilo Mountains where
the mighty ranges of the Balkans, the Upper M&oelig;sian,
and the Rhodope are thrown close together, was
sufficiently grand to engross the eye and mind of the
dashing riders. Thus most of the day was passed in
silence, broken only by the clatter of the horses' hoofs
against the rocks; the roar of cascades making their
awful plunge hundreds of feet from the precipices;
the complaint of rivers far down at the bottom of
ravines, fretting beneath the prison roof of ice and
snow; and glorious pines, pluming the brow of crag
and ledge, through which the everlasting winds
breathed the dirge over fallen empires of men.</p>

<p>As they forced their way up a long and tedious
ascent, Scanderbeg joined Kabilovitsch and said:</p>

<p>"To relieve the tedium of this slow part of the journey
you must tell me about that lass you would not
leave for the love of Albania. A sweet face as I saw
it. I could have run off with it myself, had I not
other business on hand. And I can pardon a father's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
heart for clinging very closely to such a child. You
will forget my rude speech a while ago. I played with
a little lass like that when I was a boy. The face of
your child, that night I watched for you, carried me
back to those happy days. I could see my little
sweet-heart in her; though thirty years have thrown
their shadows of dark events across my memory."</p>

<p>Kabilovitsch turned familiarly to Scanderbeg with
the query,</p>

<p>"May I read your thoughts, Sire?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is welcome to do so who can find my soul
beneath this battered face."</p>

<p>"That child was the fair Mara, the daughter of the
noble George Cernoviche, whose castle ruins lie now
by the shore of Ochrida. Am I not right?"</p>

<p>"Right! but I knew not of the fall of her father's
house. Can you tell me aught of the history of my
little maiden. If she lives, she must be a goodly
matron now."</p>

<p>"Yes, I can tell her story and more. She married
the noble Musache de Streeses, whose castle once
stood near the Skadar."<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>"Ah! I have heard of his sad fate," replied the
general. "Oh, for vengeance on these villains who have
despoiled the land! Musache de Streeses was the
richest of all the land-owners on the coast of Adria,
the soul of honor, a genuine patriot, with whom my
father held confidential intercourse. His purse and
sword were freely offered for service against the Turk.
It was a favorite scheme of my father to some day
unite our families. I hear that my nephew,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Amesa, has become possessed of those estates, being
also nephew to De Streeses, who was slain by the
Turks. But my fairy, Mara, you said was married to
De Streeses. It was she, then, who, with her infant
child, was killed by the Turks during the raid?"</p>

<p>"Noble Castriot! De Streeses and the Lady Mara
were murdered, foully, treacherously," said the old
man, reining his horse, and speaking with terrible
passion.</p>

<p>"Oh, to take vengeance!" exclaimed Scanderbeg.
"By the fair face of Mara! this, with the thousand
other murders of these years, shall be washed out, if
my sword drains a myriad veins of Turkish blood to
make sure of his who struck so brutal a blow!"</p>

<p>"Your sword need not search so wide as that,"
said Kabilovitsch. "The family of De Streeses were
murdered by hands we both know but too well."</p>

<p>"How know you, Kabilovitsch?"</p>

<p>The man removed his cap as if inviting the inspection
of his face, and, lowering his voice, replied,</p>

<p>"I am not Kabilovitsch, I am Arnaud."</p>

<p>"Arnaud, the forester of De Streeses? Arnaud,
whose shoulders I bestrode before I ever mounted a
steed?" exclaimed Scanderbeg, turning his horse and
stopping, but at his companion's motion indicating
caution, lowering his tone, and moving close beside
him.</p>

<p>"The same, Sire. And the Turks who murdered the
nobleman and his beautiful wife were not such Turks
as you have been accustomed to command. Too
white of skin and too black of heart were they. I
would not say this, but that I give you also my reasons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
for so grave an accusation. Turks in raiding do not
discriminate in their depredations; but these harmed
not a leaf beyond the castle of De Streeses. Nor do
Turks swear by St. John, as I heard one of them do
as he cursed a fellow villain for some slip in the plan.
Nor again would Turks, seeking only for plunder,
have shown as much eagerness to kill the little babe
as they did to slay its father; and this they did, searching
even among the ashes for evidence that the tiny
bones had been sufficiently charred to prevent their
recognition. But the child was not in the castle at the
time. My good wife was suckling it&mdash;the Lady Mara
being of delicate condition&mdash;and that night the babe
was at the lodge. As soon as the commotion was
heard at the castle the child was hidden in the copse."</p>

<p>"But where is this child now?" asked Scanderbeg
eagerly.</p>

<p>"You have gazed upon her by my camp-fire, sire;
and your soul saw in her face that of the sainted
Mara, though your eyes detected her not."</p>

<p>"And you know the perpetrator of this damnable
deed?" asked Scanderbeg.</p>

<p>"I may not say I know, since your noble father
refused to believe that any other than Turkish hands
did it. But he who possesses the estate now knows
too much of this affair to thank God in his prayers
for his inheritance. I saved the child; yet Lord
Amesa has sworn that once a Turk who fell beneath
his sword in a private brawl confessed to him that his
hands had strangled the infant on the night of the
raid. Some one interested had suspicion of where the
truth lay, for my own cot was raided, and my wife
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
slain one night during my absence. But the child
was safe elsewhere. Since then, knowing that her life
was secure only through her being secreted, I have
been a wanderer. A price was secretly set upon my
head by Amesa. In the mountains of Macedonia, in
the pass of the Balkans, have I kept watch over my
sacred charge. I want not to see Albania, but as I
can see justice done in Albania. Therefore I said I
would go only if the lass might go with me, and under
the strong protection of a Castriot who knows the
truth, whose very soul recognized the child of Mara."</p>

<p>"The child's life shall be as sacred to me as if
Mara had become my wife as she vowed in her play,
and the child were my own," said Scanderbeg. "But
this perplexes our cause. Amesa is one of our
bravest, wiliest voivodes. To antagonize him with
this old charge would imperil my reception with the
people and the liberty of our land. But I pledge you,
my good Arnaud, that though vengeance waits, it
shall not sleep. In the time when it shall be most
severe upon the offender, and most honorable to the
name of Albanian justice, the bolt shall fall."</p>

<p>It was readily foreseen by both that only at the peril
of her life could Morsinia be allowed to accompany her
foster father, Arnaud or Kabilovitsch, to the camp of
Castriot. The former forester would be recognized and
suspicion at once excited as to the person of his ward.
It was, therefore, determined that she should be
domiciled safely in a little hamlet on the borders of
Albania, where her history was unknown; and that, to
elude suspicion, Milosch and the boy, Constantine,
should accompany her, as her father and brother,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
neither of whom knew her true history. The
"Brotherhood in God" between Kabilovitsch and his
old neighbor gave sufficient warrant for Milosch's
claim to paternity.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>ut while these refugees from the little hamlet on
the mountains were so favored of good Providence,
what of the others? Our story must return to the day
of the battle in the Pass of Slatiza. Mother Helena fell
beneath the sword of a Turk while defending herself
from his insults. The boy, Michael, with arms bound
above the elbows and drawn back so that, while
retaining the use of his hands, he could not free himself,
was driven along with others under guard of several
soldiers. As they descended the mountains the
band of captives was steadily increased by contributions
from the cottages and hiding places along the way.
They were mostly boys and girls, the old men and
women having been slain or left to perish in the utter
desolation which marked the track of the army.
Some of the captives were children too young to
endure the tramp, and were carried upon the horses
of the mounted soldiers. No one was treated unkindly.
After the first day their bands were untied so that
they moved without weariness. They shared the best
of the soldiers' rations&mdash;sometimes feasting while
their captors fasted&mdash;and were snugly wrapped in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
blankets by the camp-fires at night. The daily march,
after the Christian army had abandoned the pursuit,
was of but a few miles, with long intervals for rest.
Indeed, Michael thought that the troopers were more
anxious about his being kept in good condition, even
in fresh and comely appearance, than Mother Helena
would have been. As they approached Philippopolis
they were all made to wash at a stream. Their matted
locks were combed:&mdash;a hard job with the mass of
rebellious red bristles which stood about Michael's
head, like a nimbus on the wooden image of some
Romish saint. In some instances the captors went
into the city and returned with pretty skirts of bright
colored wool or silk, and caps made of shells and
beads for the girls. Fantastic enough were the costumes
and toilets which the rough old troopers forced
upon the little maidens; but if they were pleasing to
the captors they would prove, perhaps, as pleasing to
the rough slave buyers in the market square of
Philippopolis, who purchased the girls for disposal
again at the harems of the capital. An officer of
excise presided over these sales, and, before the property
was delivered to the purchaser, retained one-fifth
the price as the share of the Sultan. If any of
the girls were, in the judgment of the officer, of peculiar
beauty or promise, they were reserved for the
royal harem; the value of them being paid to their captors
out of the tax levied upon the others. This gave
occasion for the extravagant and often ludicrous costumes
in which the diverse tastes of the soldiers
arrayed their captives for the contest of beauty.</p>

<p>The boys, however, were not sold. They were the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
special property of the Sultan, to be trained as Janizaries
for military service, or employed in menial
positions about the royal seraglio. The captors received
rewards according to the number and goodly condition
of the lads they brought in.</p>

<p>The band of boys to which Michael was attached
was marched at once to Adrianople. Several hundreds
were gathered in a great square court, which was
surrounded by barracks on three sides, and on the
fourth faced the river Marissa. A great soup kettle,
the emblem of the Janizary corps, was mounted
upon a pole in the centre of the square, and
seemed to challenge the honors of the gilt star and
crescent, the emblem of royalty, that gleamed from
the tall staff in an adjacent court of the seraglio.
There were scattered about utensils for domestic use;
the tools of carpenters, blacksmiths, armorers, harness-makers
and horse-shoers; old swords, battered helmets,
broken wagons, bow-guns, the figure heads of veteran
battering rams; indeed all the used and disused evidences
that within these walls lived a self-sustaining
community, able to provide for themselves in war or
in peace.</p>

<p>For several days the new boys were fed with delicious
milk and meats, prepared by skilful hands of old
soldiers, who knew the art of nursing the sick almost
as well as they knew that of making wounds. For a
few nights the lads slept upon soft divans, until every
trace of weariness from the journey had disappeared.
They were then stripped naked and examined carefully
by the surgeons. If one were deformed, or ill-proportioned,
or failed to give promise of a strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
constitution, he was taken away to be trained as a
woinak or drudge of the camps. Perhaps three-fourths
of the entire number in Michael's company were thus
branded for life with an adverse destiny.</p>

<p>The more favored lads were graded into ojaks, or
messes; and among them were daily contests in running
and wrestling, according to the results of which
the ojaks were constantly changing their members;
the strongest and most agile living together in honorary
distinction from their fellows.</p>

<p>The officers in charge of these Janizary schools were
old or crippled men, whom years or wounds had
rendered unfit for service in the field, and who were
assigned to the easier task in compensation for past
fidelity. The spirit of the veterans was thus infused into
the young recruits by constant contact and familiarity
with them; and the rigid habits of the after service
were acquired almost insensibly through the daily drill
and discipline.</p>

<p>Michael's rugged health and mountain training
enabled him to advance rapidly through the various
grades. Though almost the youngest in his company,
he was the first in the race, and no one could take him
from his feet in the wrestling match.</p>

<p>"A sturdy little Giaour," said old Selim, a fat and
gouty Janizary, the creases of whose double chin were
good companions to the sabre-scar across his cheek.</p>

<p>"Ay, tough and handy!" responded Mustapha,
an old captain of the corps, ogling Michael with his
widowed eye, and stroking his beard with his equally
bereaved hand, as he watched the boy wriggling from
beneath to the top of a companion nearly double his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
size. "If the little fellow is as agile in wit as he is in
limb he will not long be among the Agiamoglans.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> A
splendid build! broad in the shoulders; deep-chested,
but not flat; narrow loins; compact hips&mdash;just the
make of a lion. As lithe a lad as you were once, my
now elephantine Selim, when Bajazet stole you from
your Hungarian home. Ah! you have changed somewhat
since the old Padishah had you for his page. I
remember when your waist was as trim as a squirrel's&mdash;but
now&mdash;from the look of your paunch I would
think you were the soldier who drank up the poor
woman's supper of goat's milk, and had his belly
ripped open by the Padishah to discover his guilt.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
Only goat's milk swells like that. Let us see if some
of the butter sticks not yet to your ribs," said the old
soldier, making a pass at his comrade's middle.</p>

<p>"That's not a true soldier's pass, to strike so low,"
said Selim, laughing. "But you, Mustapha, were once
a better runner than yon lad will ever be."</p>

<p>"I was as good with my legs as with my arms,"
replied the veteran, pleased with the compliment, and
fondling his bare calves with his hand. "But at what
match did you see me run?"</p>

<p>"I only saw you run once," said Selim, "and that
was at Angora, when Timour the Lame<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> was after you
to get your ugly head for the pyramid of skulls he left
there as a monument. But see the lad! He tosses
the big one as a panther topples an ox. We have not
had his match in the school since Scanderbeg was a boy."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor Scanderbeg!" said Mustapha.</p>

<p>"How now!" inquired Selim, "is there any news
from him?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He has met his first defeat. He was in
command at the last battle under the Balkans. Carambey
got fast in a bog, in the first battle, and Scanderbeg
was unable to redeem the defeat in the second.
But he lived not to know it. He sent a host of gibbering
Giaour ghosts to hell while on his way to heaven.
'In the crossing of the cimeters there is the gate of
paradise,' says the Koran; and, though his body
could not be found, he went through the gate, beyond
a doubt."</p>

<p>"That is a loss, comrade, the Padishah can never
make good with any man in the service. But have
you not noted, Mustapha, that Scanderbeg never
fought so well against Christians as against the Caramanians,
the Kermians and rebellious Turks. In
Anatolia I have seen his lips burst with blood,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> through
sheer rage of fight; but in Servia he seemed listless
and without heart for the fray. The Grand Vizier
has noted it, and twitted him with remembering too
well that he was Christian born."</p>

<p>"And how did he take that?"</p>

<p>"Why, the color came to his face; his lips swelled;
his whole body shook;&mdash;just as I have seen him when
compelled to restrain himself from heading a charge,
because the best moment for it had not arrived."</p>

<p>"Did the Vizier take note of his manner?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and spoke of it to the Padishah. Amurath
looked troubled, and I overheard him say, 'I must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
not believe it, for I need him. No other general can
match Hunyades.' And the Padishah said well; and
he had done well if he had taken the Vizier's head
from his shoulders for such an insinuation. For Scanderbeg
only half loyal were better than all the rest of
the generals licking the Padishah's feet. But, Mustapha,
we must train the little devil yonder to forget
that he ever heard the name of Jesu, Son of Mary,
except from the Koran."</p>

<p>"Let us see if he has as much courage as he has
cartilage," said Mustapha. "The day is one fit for the
water test. Let us have the squad on the river's bank.
If you will bring them, I will go and arrange the test."</p>

<p>"It is too cold, and besides I do not like it," said
Selim. "I have known some of the best and hottest
blood that ever boiled in a child's veins to be chilled
forever by it. It is too severe, except for trout."</p>

<p>"But it is commanded. And to-day is as mild as
we shall have for a whole moon yet," was the reply, as
Mustapha moved toward the water.</p>

<p>The river Marissa was covered with thin ice, not
strong enough to bear the weight of a person. A young
woinak had attached a small red flag to a block of
wood, and whirled it out over the slippery surface
some three rods from the shore. The boys gathered
naked and shivering at the barrack doors, and, at a
signal were to dash after the flag. All hesitated at the
strange and cruel command, until a whip, snapping
close to their bare backs, started them. Some slipped
and fell upon the rough and icy stones of the paving
in the court. Others halted at the river's edge. Only
a few ventured upon the brittle ice; and they, as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
broke beneath them, scrambled back to the shore. One
or two fainted in the shock of the cold plunge, and
were drawn in by the woinaks. But three pressed on,
breaking the ice before them with their arms, or with
the whole weight of their bodies, as they climbed upon
its brittle edge. Soon they were beyond their depth;
one dared to go no further, and, blue and bleeding,
gave up the chase. The prize lay between Michael
and his companion. This boy was larger and older
than he; and finding that the ice would sustain his
weight, stretched himself on it, and crawled forward
until he grasped the flag. But the momentary pause,
as he detached it from the wooden block and put it
between his teeth, was sufficient to allow the crackling
bridge to break beneath him; and he sunk out of
sight. At the same instant Michael disappeared.
Though several yards from his companion, he
plunged beneath the ice, and reappeared carrying the
flag in his teeth and holding his comrade's head above
the water until the woinaks could reach and rescue
them both.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" shouted the attendants. The boys were
hurried into the barracks, and given a hot drink made
from a decoction of strong mints; while the woinaks
smeared their bodies with the same, and rubbed them
until the shock of their exposure was counteracted by
the generous return of the natural heat.</p>

<p>"I thought," said old Mustapha, "that we would
have drowned some to-day. It is a cruel custom; but
it is worth months of other practices to find out a lad's
clear grit and power of endurance. The two boys
who got the flag will some day become as valiant as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
ourselves, eh, Selim?" and the living eye of the veteran
nodded to the empty socket across his nose&mdash;the
nearest approach to a wink he was capable of.</p>

<p>"As the boys were floundering in the water," said
Selim, "I thought of a scene which I saw about at the
same spot&mdash;now three score years have gone since it&mdash;for
it was just after I was brought into the Janizary's
school. Our Padishah's great grandfather, the first
Amurath, had erected a high seat or throne on the
river's bank yonder. You know that Saoudji, the
Padishah's son, had joined the Greeks; but the young
traitor was captured. Well! old Amurath bade the
executioner pass the red hot iron before his son's eyes
until the sight was dried up in them. Then, while the
blind prince was groping about and begging for mercy,
the Padishah, his father, commanded a circle of
swordsmen to be formed about him, swinging their
cimeters, so that his head would fall by the hand of
him whom he chanced to approach. Thus it might
be said, that since he was a king's son, he had used
the princely privilege of selecting his own executioner.
And having thus set them an example of paternal duty,
Amurath commanded the fathers of the Greek youths,
whom he had captured, to cut off the heads each
of his own son. Those whose fathers were not
known or could not be found, were tied together in
groups and thrown into the stream; the Padishah betting
heavily with the Grand Vizier upon those who
should float the longest. So, cruel though our customs
are, you see, Mustapha, we are not so barbaric
as our ancestors."</p>

<p>"Nor so abominably vicious as the Greeks," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Mustapha. "With them the loving mothers put out the
eyes of their children.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> No, we are quite gentle nurses
of the lads committed to our charge, though sometimes
our tiger claws will prick through the velvet."</p>

<p>"Come, help me up! good Mustapha," said Selim,
trying to rise from a bench in the sunshine of the
court where they were sitting. "The cold stiffens
my bones."</p>

<p>"Bah! comrade, you have no bones, only flesh and
belly. How will you balance your fat hulk on the
bridge that is finer than a hair and sharper than the
edge of a sword that takes you over hell into paradise?
I fear me, Selim, that I shall have to content
myself with the company of the Prophet and the
houris in heaven, for you will never get there, unless
I give you a lift across Al Sirat,"<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> said Mustapha,
giving his comrade a jerk which sent him far out into
the court, where with difficulty he kept his feet upon
the slippery stones.</p>

<p>The old fellow took the rough play good-naturedly,
and replied,</p>

<p>"You will never see paradise, Mustapha. The
houris will have nought to do with so ugly a face as
yours. It will turn them all squint-eyed to look at
you."</p>

<p>"Do you think I know not the art of love-making?"
said Mustapha, striking the attitude of a fashionable
young man of the day.</p>

<p>Selim roared with laughter. "Mustapha making
love? The thing is impossible; since, if the houri
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
be in the sunshine of your good eye, you have no arm
on that side to embrace her; and if you embrace her
with the arm you have got, you have no eye on that
side to look upon her beauty. Trust me, you old
moulted peacock, that I shall get over Al Sirat before
Mustapha has found a houri&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hist!" said Mustapha, pointing to the entrance
of the square from the seraglio court adjoining, and
assuming an attitude of the gravest dignity. In a
moment more the two officers knelt, and resting their
foreheads on the ground, remained in that position
until a lad of some twelve years approached them and
touched the head of each with his foot, bidding them
rise.</p>

<p>"I have come, good Selim, to see what new hounds
you have for me," said the young Prince Mahomet.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>"Ah! my little Hoonkeawr!<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> the Prophet, your
namesake, has sent you a fine one; as lithe as a greyhound
and as strong as a mastiff; and, if I mistake
not, already trained for the game; for he came from
the Balkans, where foxes run wild when and where
they will."</p>

<p>"That is capital. I shall like him," cried the prince,
with delight. "I must see him."</p>

<p>"Not to-day, your highness; for the boys are
under the leech's charge. They have been put to the
water-test, and are all packed snugly in their beds."</p>

<p>"The water-test, Selim, and you called me not?"
said the boy, looking furious in his rage. "You
knew I wanted to see it; and you told me not for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
spite. You will pay for this one day, you fat villain!
And I want the hunt now. I came for it; did I not,
Yusef?" addressing a eunuch, an old man with ashen
face and decrepit body, but gorgeously arrayed, who
accompanied the prince as his constant attendant.</p>

<p>"We must wait, I suppose," said the man, with a
supercilious tone and toss of his head, as if to even
speak in the presence of the soldiers were a degradation
to his dignity.</p>

<p>"To-morrow we will have the hunt in better style
than we could arrange it now were the boys able," said
Selim, endeavoring to appease the young tyrant.</p>

<p>The prince and his escort moved away without
deigning a reply</p>

<p>"It is best not to insist," said the eunuch. "A
wise maxim I will give thee, my prince:&mdash;Beware of
demanding the impossible&mdash;check back even the desire
of it. The rule of the Janizary school is that the boys
have rest after the water-test, and the Padishah would
not allow even his own son to break it. I would train
thee to self-command; for the time may come when
thou shalt command the empire. Your brother,
Aladdin, is mortal."</p>

<p>"So you always interfere with me. You hate me,
Yusef; I know you do. I wish the boys had all
been drowned in the river, and old Selim, and you
too," cried the royal lad, giving way to an outburst of
childish rage.</p>

<p>"Wait until thou canst get the bit between thy
teeth before attempting to run thine own gait," coolly
replied the old eunuch.

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>eyond the walls of the seraglio lay the royal
hunting grounds. Many acres of the city were
enclosed within high walls of clayey earth, packed
into huge square blocks and dried in the sun; on the
top and outside of which bristled a miniature abattis
of prickly vines. Some parts of this park were adorned
with every elegance that the art of landscape gardening
could devise. In the summer season these portions
were covered with floral beauties, interspersed
with water-jets, which tossed the light silver balls like
fairy jugglers; broad basins sparkling with gold fish;
and walks leading to little kiosks and arbors. Even
its winter shroud could not conceal from the imagination
what must have been its living beauty in summer.</p>

<p>The greater part of this reserve was, however, left
in its natural state. Gnarled old olive trees twisted
themselves like huge serpents above the dense copses
of elder and hazel bushes. Dusky balsams rose in
pyramids, overtopped by the pines, which spread their
branches like umbrellas. Here and there were open
fields, encumbered with stinted underbrush, and either
broken with out-cropping rocks, or smooth with strips
of meadow land now white and glistening under the
snow.</p>

<p>This section of the park presented a fascinating
appearance on the day of the fox-hunt. Scores of
lads from the Janizary school were there, dressed in all
shades of bright-colored jackets, and short trousers
bagged at the knees; the lower part of the limbs being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
protected with close-fitting stockings of leather, terminating
in light, but strong, sandals. Each wore a
skull cap or fez of red flannel, from the top of which
and down the back hung a tassel, that, by its length
and richness, indicated some prize won by its wearer
in previous games. Old soldiers gathered here and
there in groups; some, the Janizaries, wearing tall
sugar-loaf-shaped hats of gray; others, white turbans,
or green ones, indicating that their possessors had made
a holy pilgrimage to Mecca. Elegant burnooses, or
sleeveless cloaks, of white, black, orange and yellow
silks, fluttered in the wind or were gathered at the
waist by rich sashes, from which hung great cimeters.</p>

<p>Near an open spot was a stand, or running gallery,
enclosed in lattice-work, from behind which the ladies
of the harem could witness the sports, themselves
unseen. The presence of these invisible beauties was
indicated by the stiff, straight forms of the black
eunuchs, whose faces appeared above their white
cloaks like heads of ebony on statues of alabaster.</p>

<p>Prince Mahomet rode a horse, small but compactly
built, with head and mane suggestive of the
power of his well-rounded muscles; slim ankles, seemingly
better adapted to carry the lighter form of a deer;
jet black, in strongest contrast with the white tunic
and gaily embroidered jacket of the little prince, as
well as with the saddle-cloth of purple silk, in which
the star and crescent were wrought with threads of gold.
With merry shout the young tyrant chased the boys,
who, carrying wands decorated with ribbons, ran ahead
of him to clear the way.</p>

<p>"So it will be if he ever comes to the throne," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
Selim to a comrade. "Mahomet II. would follow no
one. There would be no use of viziers and generals,
and he would even attempt to drive the Janizaries like
his sheep. It is well that Aladdin is the elder."</p>

<p>"But woe to Aladdin if Mahomet lives after his
brother comes to the throne," said the man addressed.
"With such fire-boxes about him one could justify the
practice of a sovereign inaugurating his reign by the
slaughter of his next of kin."<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The woinaks brought in several crates, with latticed
sides, containing the foxes, which, one by one, were to
be let loose for the chase; the boys to act the part of
hounds, and drive the game from the thickets, in which
they would naturally take refuge, out into the open
space, and within arrow range of the prince. Mahomet,
by constant practice, had acquired great dexterity in
managing his steed, and almost unerring aim in using
the bow from the horse's back.</p>

<p>A splendid red fox was thrust out of the crate. For
a moment he remained crouching and trembling in his
fright at the crowd; then darted suddenly for the
underbrush. The boys, imitating the sharp cry or prolonged
baying of a pack of hounds, scattered in different
directions; some disappearing in the copse;
others stationing themselves at the openings or run-ways
where they thought the animal would appear.
The bugle of the white eunuch, who was constantly
near the prince, kept all informed of his position, so
that reynard might be driven toward him. In a few
moments the arrow of Mahomet laid him low.</p>

<p>A second fox was liberated&mdash;like many of the Sultan's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
nobler creatures&mdash;only to fly to his speedy execution.
The third animal was an old one, who persisted
in taking the direction opposite to that in which the
chasers would drive him. Again and again, as the boys
closed about him, he dashed through the thickest of their
legs, leaving them tumbled together in a heap. At one
time he sprang through the opening at which Michael,
studying the tricks of the quick-witted brute, had stationed
himself. Sudden as were his movements, the
young mountaineer's were not less so; for, like a veritable
hound, he threw himself bodily upon the prey.
Passing his right hand beneath the entire length of
the animal's body from the rear, he grasped his front
leg and bent it back beneath him; at the same time
using his whole weight to keep the animal's head close
to the ground, so as to escape his fangs. He had
taken more than one beast in a similar way from the
holes in the old mountain pass. In the excitement of
the sport he now forgot that he was merely to enable
another to get the game without effort or danger.</p>

<p>Prince Mahomet rode to the spot toward which the
fox had turned, and, in a sudden outburst of anger at
this interference with his shot, drove the arrow at the
two as they were struggling on the ground. The whirring
barb cut the arm of Michael before it entered the
heart of the prey. The sharp cry of pain uttered by
the lad recalled Mahomet from his insane rage. The
rushing attendants showed pity for Michael, but no
one ventured a remonstrance against this act of imperial
cowardice and cruelty. A moment's examination
showed that the lad's wound was not serious, being
only a cut through the flesh. But as the pallor of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
fright died away from his face, it was followed by a
deep flush of anger. Tears of vexation filled his eyes.
His glance of scorn was hardly swifter than his leap:
for, with a bound, his arms were around the prince's
body, while his weight dragged him from the saddle to
the ground. Mahomet, rising, drew a jeweled dagger,
and made several hasty passes at his assailant, who,
however, dextrously avoided them. The posing of
the lads would have done justice to the fame of professional
gladiators. The prince pressed upon his
antagonist with incessant thrusts, which, by skilful
retreating and parries with his bare arm, Michael
avoided; until, with a ringing blow upon Mahomet's
wrist, he sent the weapon from his hand, and closed
with him; the prince falling to the ground beneath the
greater strength of Michael.</p>

<p>The spectators at this point interfered. As they
rose the eunuch grasped the little victor, and shaking
him, cried: "I will cut the throat of the Giaour cub of
hell."</p>

<p>But the one hand of old Mustapha was upon the
eunuch's throat, and his one eye flashed like a discharging
culverin, as he cried, "Had I another hand to do
it with, I would cut yours, you white-faced imbecile!
Don't you know that the boy belongs to the Janizaries?
and woe to him who is not a Janizary that lays
a hand on him!"</p>

<p>"The prince's honor must be avenged," wheezed
out the eunuch between the finger grips of the old
soldier. "I care not for the Janizary, though you
were the Aga<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> himself, instead of a mutilated slave."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span></p>

<p>The eunuch had drawn his dagger, and was working
his hand into a position whence he could strike,
when old Selim's hand grasped his.</p>

<p>"None of that treachery, or we will let out of your
leprous skin what manhood is left in you, you blotch
on your race! Touch one hair of Black Khalil's<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
children and you die like the dog you are. Let him
go, Mustapha! His coward throat is no place for you
to soil a brave hand. We will get a snake to strangle
him; a buzzard to pick his grain of a soul out of his
vile carcass;<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> an ass to kick him to death. We must
observe the proprieties."</p>

<p>"Pardon my heat!" said the eunuch. "My zeal for
my prince has led me too far."</p>

<p>"Not at all!" said Selim. "It is pleasant to see that
you have some heat in your cold blooded toad nature."</p>

<p>"It is better for us to retire," said the eunuch to
Mahomet. "I shall sound the signal for the close of
the games."</p>

<p>Mahomet stood stubbornly for awhile; then turning
to Michael said in a tone which was strangely without
a shade of anger or petulance in it:</p>

<p>"Say, young Giaour, you and I must have this out
some day."</p>

<p>Michael could not help a half-smiling recognition
of the boyish challenge, and replied:</p>

<p>"I have seen more foxes than you have, and know
some tricks I didn't show you to-day."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>As they moved out of the park, Yusef delivered a
brief lecture to his princely pupil. "Hark thee, my
master. I warn thee, that thou have an eye always
open and a hand always closed to the Janizaries.
They have grown from being the heel to think that
they are the head of the state. They dictate to thy
father, the Padishah, and snub the very Vizier. I
would have killed both those old imbeciles, but that
it would not have been politic. I am glad, too, that
thou didst not let thy dagger find the heart of the
Balkan boy. That would not have been politic.
For, Allah grant! thou mayest one day be Padishah.
Then this day would be remembered against us."</p>

<p>"But, Yusef, I did not spare the boy. I think he
spared me; and if I ever get to be Padishah, I will
make him my vizier, for his cleverness. It would be a
pity that so brave a man were elsewhere than at my
right hand. Though he angered me awfully at the
moment, I shall like that fellow. Did you see how he
gripped the fox with his bare arms? He must teach
me how to do that. Was it between the hind legs he
thrust his hand, or across the beast's body? I could
not see for my being so mad because he spoiled for me
a fine running shot."</p>

<p>"Thou art a strange child, Mahomet. Thou seemest
to have forgotten that the boy leaped at thy throat,
and would have torn out thine eyes, but that thou
wast more valiant than he."</p>

<p>"Well, I should despise him as white-livered and
milk-galled if he had not sprung at me," said Mahomet.
"Has not every noble fellow quick blood,
as well as a prince, Yusef? That boy shall be mine.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
He shall teach me his tricks, and I shall give him all
my sweetmeats; for they get none of such things in
the school."</p>

<p>"Ah! my little prince, thy head is as full of wit as
a fig is of seeds. Thou art gifted to know and use
men. One that is born to rule must make his passion
bend to policy. He must not allow himself the pleasure
of hating those whom he can use. But take heed
of this:&mdash;whom he cannot use he must not love."</p>

<p>"But I was not born to rule, Yusef. If so, I would
have been born earlier, before my brother Aladdin
cried in his nurse's arms, and would not be comforted
until they had covered the soft spot on his bare head
with a paper crown. Do you believe in omens, Yusef?"</p>

<p>"Not in such; only in dreams," said the eunuch.</p>

<p>"Well; I dreamed that our two heads&mdash;yours and
mine, Yusef&mdash;were together on a pike-staff, grinning
at Aladdin's coronation."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, child!" said the eunuch, his white face
bleaching a shade whiter under the thought, as they
passed through the gateway into the seraglio grounds.</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he physical training of the young Janizaries consisted
in such daily exercises as would develop
strength and tirelessness of muscle, steadiness of nerve,
keenness and accuracy of eye, as well as grace of mien.
They were also taught by expert workmen all the arts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
of daily need; to make as well as to use the bow; to
trim and balance the arrow; to forge, temper, and
sharpen the sword; to shoe the horse; to make and
mend their clothing and the entire trappings of their
steeds; to build and manage the keelless kaiks<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> which
darted like fishes through the surface of the river;
to bind rafts into pontoons for the crossing of streams;
to reap and grind the grain, and cook their food.
Any special talent or adaptability was noted by the
instructors, and the Janizaries encouraged to attain to
rare expertness in single arts.</p>

<p>The training in arms was especially severe, and
under masters in fencing, archery, riding, swimming,
marching, deploying&mdash;the ablest tacticians, whose
wounds or age permitted their absence from active
campaigns, being found always at the head of the
various departments. The Janizary, while a mere lad
in years, was often more than a match in single combat
for the most stalwart men in other corps, such as
the Piadé and Azabs among footmen, the Ouloufedji
and Akindji among troopers.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding this individual prowess and
ambition were stimulated to the highest degree, they
were disciplined to abject obedience within the corps.
Each one was as a part of some intricate mechanism, all
moved by one spring, which was the will of the chief
Aga. At a moment's notice they must start, in companies
or alone; on military expeditions, or secret
service as spies and scouts; it might be to the recesses
of Asia or the upper Danube; to assail forts
or to conduct intrigues; having always but one incentive,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
that of the common service and the common
glory.</p>

<p>To develop in the same person these two seemingly
antagonistic qualities&mdash;of intensest individuality and
abject subserviency to their order&mdash;required the
shrewdest manipulation of the mind and will of the
cadet from his earliest enrollment in childhood. As
certain expert horse-trainers control the spirit of
noble steeds, without extinguishing any of their fiery
ardor, and tell the secret of their power to those who
come after them in the guild, so from the days of
Black Khalil this marvellous system of discipline had
been perpetuated among the corps, producing but
rarely a weakling and as rarely a rebel.</p>

<p>Michael learned his first lesson in subordination
upon the return from the hunt. While the Janizary
officers were not displeased with the prowess the little
fellow had shown, even against the prince, it was foreseen
that such an impetuous nature needed the curb.
For three days he was confined to a room in solitude
and silence. No one spoke or listened to him. His
only attendant was an old man, both deaf and dumb,
who evidently knew nothing and cared nothing for
Michael's offence or its punishment.</p>

<p>During this time the lad's suspense was terrible.
Was he to be killed for having assaulted the prince?
Would they take him to the torture? Perhaps this
old man had been guilty of some such offence, and
they had cut his tongue and bored out his ears! He
had heard of the searing iron passed before the eyes,
and then the life-long darkness. When he slept his
overwrought imagination fabricated horrid dreams in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
which he was the victim of every species of cruelty. He
fancied that he was being eaten by a kennel of foxes, to
whom he is given every day until their hunger shall be
satisfied; then taken away and reserved for their next
meal. He tried to compute how many days he would
last. Sometimes he imagined that he was exposed
naked in the cold, and made to stand day and night
on the ice of the Marissa, until he should be frozen:
but his heart is so hot with his rebel spirit that it will
not freeze. Once he thought that Prince Mahomet
came each day and stabbed him with that pearl-set
dagger he drew on him at the hunt.</p>

<p>His dreams were too frightful to allow him to sleep
long at a time; yet, when awake, his fears were such
that he longed to get back again among the terrible
creatures of his fancy. Oh, that some one would
speak to him, and tell him his fate! He would welcome
the worst torture, if only he could be allowed to
talk to the torturer.</p>

<p>After a while rage took the place of, or at least
began to alternate with, fear. He regretted that he
had not killed the impudent prince.</p>

<p>"There stands his horse," he would say to himself&mdash;marking
a line on the wall&mdash;"now I leap; seize his
dagger; strike him to the heart; and, before they can
stop me, plunge it into my own heart, so! Ah! when
I am out of this place I will kill him! I will! and go
down to hell with him!" And the little frame would
swell, and the eyes gleam with demoniacal light
through the dusky chamber.</p>

<p>There are deep places even in a child's soul&mdash;ay,
bottomless depths&mdash;which, when unfretted by temptation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
are so tranquil and clear that the kindliness and
joy of heaven are reflected in them, warranting the
saying of the old Jewish Rabbis, "Every child is a
prophet of the pure and loving God." But when
disturbed by a sense of wrong and injury, these depths
in a child's heart may rage as a caldron hot with the
fires of hell; as a geyser pouring out the wrath and
hatred which we conceive to be born only in the
nether world.</p>

<p>After a time Michael's fury died away. Another
feeling took its place&mdash;the crushing sense of his
impotence. His will seemed to be broken by the
violence of its own spasm. He was stunned by his
realization of weakness. He fell with his face to the
cold stones of the floor, moaning at first, but soon
passing into a waking stupor in which only consciousness
remained: hopeless, purposeless, without energy
to strive, and without strength to cry&mdash;a perfectly
passive spirit. The centipede that crawled from the
dusty crevice of the walls, and raised half his body to
look at the strange figure lying there, might have commanded
him. The spider might have captured him,
and spun about his soul a web of destiny, if only he
could have conveyed a thought of it from his tiny eyes.
For, as the body faints, so also does the spirit under
the pressure of woe.</p>

<p>The old mute brought in the meal on the third day,
placed it beside him, and retired. An hour later he
returned and found the bread untasted; the child in
the same attitude, but not asleep. He touched him
with his foot, but evoked no sign that his presence
was recognized. He gazed for a few moments; then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
shook his head like an artisan who, upon inspecting
some piece of work he has been making, is not satisfied
with it.</p>

<p>He summoned Selim. The old soldier, finding that
his entrance did not arouse the lad, crossed his legs
upon the floor beside him, and waited. The light from
the high window of the room fell upon Selim's
wrinkled face. But it seemed as if another light, one
from within, blended with it. His harsh features
were permeated by a glow and softness, as he gazed
upon the exhausted child. His eyes filled with tears;
but they were speedily dried by the stare with which
he turned and looked first at the blank walls, and then,
following back the ray of light, to the window and
beyond; his soul transported far away over lands,
through years, to a cottage on the banks of the Grau.
He saw there a face so beautiful! was it really of one
he once called "Mother?" or a dim and hazy recollection
of a painting of the Christian Madonna he had
seen in his childhood? Happy groups of village children
were playing down among the lilies by the
water's edge, and over the hills gently sloping back
from the river's bank. Their faces were as clear cut
there against the blue sky beyond the window, as once&mdash;sixty
years ago&mdash;they were against the green grass
of the meadow. He heard again the sweet ring of the
chapel bell echoing back from the ragged rocks of the
opposite shore. And now the midnight alarm!
A fight with strange looking turbaned men! Flames
bursting from the houses of the hamlet! Men shrieking
with wounds, and women struggling in the arms of
captors! And a little child, ah, so lonely and tired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
with a long march! and that child&mdash;himself!&mdash;His
eyes rested as fondly upon Michael as did ever a
father's upon his boy.</p>

<p>But as the wind extinguishes a candle, a movement
of Michael sent all the gleams gathered out of former
days from old Selim's features. Severity, almost
savageness, took the place of kindliness among the
wrinkles of his countenance, as naturally as the waters
of a rivulet, held back for a moment by a child's hand,
fill again their channels.</p>

<p>The boy raised his head. His face was pale; the
eyes sunken; their natural brilliance deepened, but as
that of the flashing waters is deepened when it is
frozen into the glistening icicle. Or shall we say that
the dancing flames of the child's eyes had become the
steady glow of embered coals;&mdash;their life gone out,
but the hot core left there, not to cheer, only to
burn. Those three days of silence, with their successive
dramas of mystery, terror, rage and depression,
had wrought more changes in him than many years of
merely external discipline would have done.</p>

<p>The close searching glance of Selim detected all
this; and also that the child was in a critical condition.
The will was broken, but it was not certain that
this had not been accomplished by the breaking of the
entire spirit; instead of curbing, destroying it: not
taming the tiger's daring, but converting it into the
sluggishness and timidity of the cat.</p>

<p>"Michael!" cried he.</p>

<p>There was no response except the slight inclination
of the head indicating that the word had been heard.</p>

<p>"Follow me!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>The lad rose mechanically, showing no interest or
attention beyond that required for bodily obedience.</p>

<p>Pausing at the door-way the old man put his hand
upon the boy's shoulder and said sternly, yet with a
caution ready to change his tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you know that we have power to more severely
punish you?"</p>

<p>The words made no impression upon the child.</p>

<p>"The bastinado? The cage?" The boy raised
his face, but upon it was no evidence of fear; perhaps
of scorn. He had suffered so much that threats had
no power over him.</p>

<p>Selim was alarmed at these symptoms. His experience
with such cases taught him that this lethargic
spell must be broken at whatever cost. Feeling must
be excited; and if an appeal to the child's imagination
failed, physical pain must be inflicted. Something
must rouse him, or insanity might ensue.</p>

<p>A peculiar instrument of torture was a frame set
with needles pointing inwards. Into this sometimes a
culprit was placed, and the frame screwed so close
about the person that he could not move from a fixed
position without forcing the needles into his flesh.
This frame was put about the boy. He stared
stupidly at the approaching points, but did not shrink.
Selim pressed one of the needles quickly. Instantly
the boy uttered a cry of pain. His face blanched with
fright. The tears sprang to his eyes, and through
them came an agonizing look of entreaty.</p>

<p>Selim's whole manner changed as suddenly.
Schooled as he was to harshness; to strike one's head
from his shoulders at the command of the Aga without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
an instant's hesitation; to superintend the slow
process of a "discipline" by torture, without a
remorseful thought;&mdash;yet this was not his nature.
And now that better, deeper, truer nature, hitherto
unexercised for years, asserted itself. His heart went
out to Michael the instant there was no further necessity
for its restraint.</p>

<p>"Bravo! my little hero," cried he, catching him to
his arms. "You are of the metal of the invincibles,
and henceforth only valiant deeds, bright honors and
endless pleasures are to be yours. You shall lodge
with me to-night."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>elim's apartment was off from the common
barracks of the Janizaries. It was luxuriantly furnished
in its way. Elegant rugs lay upon the marble
floor. A divan, with silken covering, filled one end of
the room. The walls were hung with a variety of
richly wrought weapons and armor:&mdash;short swords,
long crescent-shaped cimeters, spears of polished wood
headed with glistening steel, helmets, breastplates,
greaves. Badges and honorary decorations shone
among costly robes which had accumulated since the
days when he had been a page to the Sultan Amurath
I.</p>

<p>Upon a low table, reaching to the edge of the
divan, had been placed salvers holding cups and open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
dishes of silver. A woinak entered with basins of
scented water in which to wash the hands and bathe
the face.</p>

<p>Selim placed his little guest by his side upon the
divan. Mustapha also appeared, and, removing his
shoes, made a profound and dignified salâm&mdash;quite in
contrast with his usual rough and badgering manner
when with Selim&mdash;then placed himself beside his comrade
upon the cushions. An excellent repast was
served. There was hare's flesh chopped and rolled
with rice into balls, made more savory with curry
sauce. Sweet cakes, pastry of figs and candied
orange blossoms excited a thirst for the sweetened
water, which was so strongly flavored with the juices
of fruits that the more scrupulous Moslems refused to
drink it, lest they should disobey the command of the
Koran prohibiting the use of wine.</p>

<p>The two old men vied with each other in telling
thrilling stories of adventure in battle and on secret
service; of the romance of castles and courts; of how
they won their honors and got their scars; of the
favors of princes and princesses; and of exploits in
which, though the rules of their order forbade their
marrying, they retaliated the captivity of the maiden's
eye by capturing her person. The burden of every
story was the praise of the Janizary organization,
which alone enabled them to attain such glories and
joys. The close brotherhood, which gave to each the
help of all the ten thousand, was commended by incidents
illustrating it. They told of their Aga or chief,
who was more powerful than the Grand Vizier&mdash;for
sultans made these latter by a word, and unmade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
them with equal caprice, often with the stroke of the
sword; but to touch a hair of the Aga would be for
the Sultan to lose the favor of the entire band, whom
he regarded as the main support of his throne, as
their hands had won it for his fathers. Did not the
word of Mustapha and Selim, at the fox-hunt, cow
the pride of Yusef, who was next to the Capee Aga
or chief of the white eunuchs? Yet Selim and
Mustapha were but captains in the Janizaries. No
general in any other arm of the service would have
dared to antagonize the eunuch as they did.</p>

<p>As Michael listened, his cheeks flushed and chilled
by turns with the excitement of his martial ambition.
The dreams he used to have in his mountain home, of
being a soldier and coming back covered with badges
of honor to claim Morsinia as his bride, seemed to be
dissolving into the reality. Nor was his ardor damped
when he learned from Selim that the first step toward
all this was the total surrender of himself to the service
of the brotherhood, in pledging and keeping obedience
to its rules; as a part of the body, like the hand, must
never be severed from the rest, but keep the contact
perfect in every muscle and nerve, in order to have
the strength which only the health of the whole body
can give to it. Selim explained to him how wrong it
had been for him to seize the fox, no matter how
excited he was, or how much daring it showed to do
so, since he had not been ordered to seize, but only
to turn the beast toward the Prince. Besides, to raise
a hand against the prince was treason&mdash;unless it were
ordered by the chief of the Janizaries. Therefore he
had been punished according to the Janizary discipline;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
though they would not have allowed any one
else to touch him&mdash;no not even the Padishah himself.</p>

<p>Michael's spirit was fully healed with such words.
His depression gave way to a hotter ambition and
pride of expectation than he had ever felt before,
when Selim put upon his head the whitish gray cap,
like that worn by the dervishes, and differing from it
only in having upon the back a strip of wool which
the old man thus explained, as he told the story of the
organization of the Janizary corps.</p>

<p>"The death angel, Azrael, has reaped the earth
more than five times since the mighty Othman,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> who
founded our empire, entered paradise. His queen,
Malkhatoon, the most beautiful of women, had given
him two sons. Never since Khalif Omar followed the
Prophet was nobler successor than would have been
either Alaeddin or Orchan to Othman. The stars
shone not with deeper lustre than did the wisdom of
Alaeddin. The storm never burst more resistlessly on
your Balkan mountains than did the bravery and
strength of Orchan beat down the foe. To Orchan
the empire came by will of Allah and Othman. But
to Alaeddin the new king said, 'Thou art wise, my
brother, above all men. Be thou the eyes of the
throne, and I will be its arm!' So Alaeddin was the
great minister of the mighty Orchan. To Prince
Alaeddin we owe our best laws, our system of drilling
and marching in all the Ottoman armies.</p>

<p>"But two lights are better known than one. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
in a dream the Angel Gabriel, who knows the secrets
of Allah regarding men, said to Alaeddin, 'Go look
into the eyes of Kara Khalil Tschendereli. We have
given him a thought for thee and thy people.' And
Kara Khalil said, 'Know, O wise and virtuous Prince
Alaeddin, I have been permitted in my dreams to
stand upon the wall Al Araf, that runs between paradise
and hell. In the third story of the seven which
divide perdition I saw the ghosts of the Giaours.
But while I watched their torments the spirit of
Othman, the Blessed, came to me, and, pointing to a
gate in the wall, said, in a voice so sweet that all the
birds in paradise echoed it, but so strong that it shook
the mighty wall Al Araf as if it would fall, "I charge
thee, as thou art a true believer in Mahomet, open
that gate that some of the believers in Jesu, Son of
Mary, may escape into paradise."</p>

<p>"'"What power have I for such a miracle, O Othman,"
I cried. But Othman said:</p>

<p>"'"Thou shalt save the souls of the boys among the
captives Allah gives thee in battle. Is it not written
in the Koran that all the children are at their birth
gifted with the true faith. Believe this, and teach the
captive boys to trust the Prophet, to breathe the
holy Islam of Father Abraham, and to draw the sword
for Allah. So shalt thou be a saviour of many souls.
And such valor will Allah send these rescued ones, and
such blessings shall follow them, that the Giaour
children shall conquer for thee the Giaour
nations."'</p>

<p>"And so, Michael," added Selim, "the wisdom of
earth and heaven appointed our order. We are still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
the Yeni Tscheri,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> though a century has gone by since
we were founded; for the vigor of perpetual youth is
ours.</p>

<p>"When Orchan, at such advice of Alaeddin and
Kara Khalil enrolled the first of the new troop&mdash;bright
Christian boys like yourself, Michael&mdash;they were led
to the old dervish, Hadji Beytarch, whose sanctity
was as the fragrance of paradise itself. The face of
the holy man caught the lustre of the prophecy from
heaven. As he drew the sleeve of his mantle over
each bowed head&mdash;and the strip of wool on our cap is
the sign of his sleeve&mdash;he uttered this benediction:
'Thy face shall be white and shining; thy right arm
shall be strong; thy sabre shall be keen; and thine
arrows sharp. Thou shalt be fortunate in fight, and
thou shalt never leave the battle-field save as a conqueror.'"</p>

<p>"And have they never been conquered?" asked
Michael with incredulity.</p>

<p>"Never!" cried Selim.</p>

<p>"Except," added Mustapha, "that they might prepare
themselves for some greater victory. Allah sometimes
makes known to us his will that we should
retreat; then we take up our kismet as joyfully as we
would shout the advance. That we may make sure of
Allah's will, before retreating we always assault the
enemy thrice. If at that sacred number we cannot
conquer we know that the victory has been reserved,
still held for us, but in the closed hand of Fate."</p>

<p>"But what of those who were killed? I certainly
saw many Janizaries lying dead in the snows of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
Balkans the day of the fight. Are they not conquered?"
asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Nay, more than conquerors," said Mustapha.
"If one falls in battle paradise flings wide its gates,
and troops of angels and houris come to lead his soul
in a triumphal procession into that beautiful land
where the earth is like purest musk, and where the
great Tuba tree grows&mdash;a branch of which shades the
kiosk of every believer, and bends down to place its
luscious fruit into his hand, if he so much as desires
it; where are grapes and pomegranates, and such as
for spicy sweetness have never been tasted on earth;
where are streams of water and milk and wine and
honey, whose bottoms are pebbled with pearls and
emeralds and rubies; where the houris, the fairest of
maidens, dwell close beside the believer in pavilions of
hollow pearls, and serve every wish of the faithful even
before he can utter it."<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>But Michael's eyes were heavy; and as the old veterans
diverted the conversation to some matter of
business between them, his excited imagination reproduced
the description of paradise in his dreams. Only,
the pavilion of pearl was shaped like good Uncle Kabilovitsch's
cot on the mountains, and the houris were
all fair-haired Morsinias.

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>eeks and months passed away, during which
the physical exercises of the lads in the Janizary
school were varied with lessons in the Turkish
language; and, in the case of a select number, in the
Arabic, mastering it at least sufficiently to read the
Koran, large sections of which they were compelled to
commit to memory.</p>

<p>The teachers in the Janizary schools were far from
ordinary men. They were highly learned, and, like
most Orientals of education, gifted with great eloquence.
After the daily tasks had been accomplished
the boys were gathered in a semicircle upon the floor
about the instructor, who sat cross-legged among them,
and narrated in glowing language the history of the
Prophet and his successors in the khalifate; inflaming
their young minds with the most heroic and romantic
legends of Arabia and Egypt, Algiers and Granada,
where the Koran had conquered the faith of the people
whom the swords of the true Moslems had subdued.
Wild stories of the early days of the Turks, before
Ertoghral,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> "The Right-hearted Man," led the tribes
from the banks of the Euphrates; and earlier still
when Seljuk<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> led his people from north of the Caspian;
of the settlement of their remote ancestors in
Afghanistan, where the great chief was first called
Sultan;<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> of how they had once held the religious faith
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
of Zoroaster. Indeed, myths from the very dawn of
known history, when the Turkius did all sorts of valiant
deeds in far-off China.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The Christian books were made to appear to the
young proselyte as but imperfect suggestions of the
completed teaching of the book of Mahomet; while
the peculiar dogmas of the Christians were restated
with such shrewd perversion that to the child's judgment
they seemed puerile or untrue.</p>

<p>"Behold the sky!" one would exclaim. "Is it not
one dome, like the canopy of one mighty throne? Behold
the light! Does it not pour from one sun and fill
all space with one flood? Breathe the air! Is it not the
same over all lands and in all lungs? Do not all birds
fly with one mechanism of wings? and all men live by the
same beating of the heart? How then can there be
three Gods, Allah, and Jesu and Mary, as the Christians
teach?<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> What does reason say? What does the universe
testify? What says the true and wise believer?"</p>

<p>"There is one God and Mahomet is His Prophet,"
would be the response of the pupils, bowing their
heads to the floor.</p>

<p>"Can the less contain or give out the greater? Can
a stone bring forth the orange tree? Can a stick give
birth to the eagle? A worm be the father of a man?
How, then, can we say with the Christians, that Mary
of Bethlehem is the mother of God? What says the
faithful and wise believer?"</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<p>"There is one God, and Mahomet is His prophet,"
would be the choral response.</p>

<p>"Is God weak? Can men thwart His plans? Shall
we then believe that the infidel Jews crucified the Son
of God?"</p>

<p>"God is great, and Mahomet is His Prophet,"
would roll up from the lips of the scholars.</p>

<p>"Shall we, then, kiss the toe of the pope because
he calls himself the grand vizier of Allah, when our
Janizaries can cut the throats of his soldiers, as our
brethren of Arabia destroyed the crusaders? Or shall
we kiss the hand of the patriarch of the Greeks, who
claims supremacy in the name of Allah, when already
our arms have shut up the whole Greek empire within
the walls of Constantinople? What says the faithful
and wise believer?"</p>

<p>"God is great, and Mahomet is His Prophet," is
the reply.</p>

<p>"Who would cringe and beg forgiveness at the feet
of a dirty priest, when the sword of every Janizary may
open for him who holds it the gate of paradise?"</p>

<p>Not only such arguments, but every event of the
day that could emphasize or illustrate the superiority
of the Moslem faith, was skilfully brought to bear
upon the susceptible minds of the youths. And
within the first year of Michael's cadetship one such
significant event occurred.</p>

<p>In the year of the Hegira 822,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> six months after
the flight of Scanderbeg, it was solemnly agreed between
Christian and Moslem that the sword should have rest
for ten years. A stately ceremony was made to seal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
the compact. Vladislaus of Hungary represented in
his person the pledge of kingly honor. Hunyades
gave the sanction of a soldier's word. And Cardinal
Julian was supposed to have added to the treaty the
confirmation of all that was sacred in the religion of
which he was so exalted a representative. On behalf
of the Christians, the concord was signalized by an
oath upon the Gospels. On the other side, Sultan
Amurath, in the presence of his generals and the
holiest of the Moslem dervishes, swore upon the
Koran. This compact, guarded by all that men hold
to be honorable on earth and sacred in heaven, lulled
the suspicions of the Turks. The rigid drill, the alert
espionage, the raids along the border gave way to the
indolence of the barracks and the pastimes of the
camp. Thousands of horses and their riders were
returned to till the fields in the Timars, Ziamets and
Beyliks<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> scattered throughout distant provinces.
The Sultan retired to meditate religion, or devise the
things belonging to permanent peace, in his secluded
palace at Magnesia in Asia Minor. The death of his
eldest son, Prince Aladdin, led him to put the crown
of associate Padishah upon the brow of the young
Mahomet that in these quiet times the prince might
learn the minor lessons of the art of ruling.</p>

<p>But this sense of security among the Turks offered
too strong a temptation to the cupidity of the Christian
leaders. King Vladislaus opposed conscientious
objections to any breach of the compact. Hunyades
maintained his personal honor by at first refusing to
draw his sword. But Cardinal Julian stood sponsor to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
a breach of faith, and announced that principle which
has, in the estimate of history, made his scarlet robe
the symbol of his scarlet sin&mdash;that no faith need be
kept with infidels; and, in the name of the Holy
Father, granted absolution to the chief actors for what
they were about to do.</p>

<p>Without warning, the tide of Christian conquest
poured from Servia eastward until it was checked in
that direction by the Black Sea. The hordes of Europe
then turned southward, seized upon Varna, and pitched
their camps amid the pennants of their ill-gotten victory
near to its walls. To human sight no power could
avert irrevocable disaster to the arms, if not the subversion
of the entire empire of the Ottomans in Europe.</p>

<p>In their extremity the lands of the Moslem made
their solemn appeal to Allah. Every mosque resounded
with reiterated prayers. The camps echoed the
pious invocations with loud curses and the rattle of the
preparation of armor. Scurrying messengers flew
from the centre to the circumference of the Ottoman
domain, and hastily gathered legions concentrated for
one supreme blow in retaliation for the grossness of
the insult, and in vindication of what they believed to
be the cause of honor and truth, which, in their minds,
was one with that of Allah and the Prophet.</p>

<p>The Sultan hurried from his retreat, and with marvellous
celerity marshalled the faithful against the
invaders at Varna. Riding at the head of the Janizaries,
he caused the document of the violated treaty
to be held aloft on a lance-head in the gaze of the two
armies, and with a loud voice uttered this prayer&mdash;a
strange one for a Moslem's lips&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>"O, Thou insulted Jesu, revenge the wrong done
unto Thy good name, and show Thy power upon Thy
perjured people!"</p>

<p>Victory hovered long between the contending hosts,
but at last rested with the Moslems. To make the
intervention of Allah more apparent, it was told everywhere,
how, when Amurath believed that he was
defeated, and had given the order for retreat, a soldier
seized the bridle of the Sultan's horse and turned
him back again toward the enemy. The very beast
felt the inspiration of heaven, and led the assault upon
the breaking columns of the Christians, until the
victors returned, bearing upon spear-points the
heads of Cardinal Julian and King Vladislaus; while
Hunyades fled in disgrace from the field.</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at that such an event,
which led many whole communities to renounce their
alliance with the Christian powers, and many of the
chiefs of Bosnia and Servia to accept the Moslem
faith, should have rooted that faith more deeply in
the hearts of those who already held it. A flame of
fanaticism ran throughout the Mohammedan world.
The most rabid sects increased in the number and
fury of their devotees. Many who were engaged in
useful occupations left them to became Moslem monks,
spending their lives in meditation, if perchance they
might receive more fully the blessings which heaven
seemed ready to pour upon every true believer; or to
become preachers of the jehad&mdash;the holy war against
the infidels.</p>

<p>In the schools of the Janizaries the fanaticism was
fed and fanned to a flame of utmost intensity. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
square court within their barracks was transformed
into a great prayer place of the dervishes. Here the
Howlers formed their circles, and swaying backward
and forward with flying hair and glaring eyes, grunted
their talismanic words from the Koran, until they fell
in convulsions on the pavement. And the Wheelers
spun round and round in their mystic motions until,
full of the spirit they sought, they dropped in the
dizzying dance. Learned sheiks preached the gospel
of the sword, and the imams watered the seed thus
sown with fervent prayers, until the ardent souls of the
youth seemed to have lost their human identity, and
to be transformed into sparks and flashes of some
celestial fire which was to destroy the lands of the
Christians.</p>

<p>Michael's mind was not altogether unimpressed by
the religious fanaticism that raged around him. While
in quiet moments he was troubled with what he heard
against the Christian faith which he had been taught
in his mountain home, at other times he was caught
in the tide of the general enthusiasm and felt himself
borne along with it, swirled around in the rings of the
mad maelstrom; not unwilling to yield himself to the
excitement, and yet by no definite purpose committing
himself to it. If it requires all the strength of an
adult mind, with convictions long held and character
well formed, to maintain its faith and principles
against the attrition of daily temptation in a Christian
land, we must not be surprised if the child gave way
to the incessant appeal of the Moslem belief, accompanied
as it was by extravagant promises of secular pleasure,
and counteracted by no word of Christian counsel.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<p>But the spiritual impulse in Michael was less active
than the martial instinct; and this latter was stimulated
to the utmost by the associations of every day
and hour. The battles which were fought on the
great fields were all refought in the vivid descriptions
of the Janizary teachers, and sometimes in the mimic
rencounters of the playground. Michael rebelled
against his childish years which prevented his joining
some of the great expeditions that were fitted out;&mdash;against
the Greeks of the Peloponnesus, the Giaour
lands to the north, and the Albanians on the west,
who, under Scanderbeg, had become the chief menace
against the Ottoman power.</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he career of Scanderbeg, or Castriot, as the Albanians
love to call their great national hero,
makes one of the most illustrious pages in history,
whether we look for the display of personal courage,
astute generalship, or loftiest patriotism. His military
renown, already so wide-spread as the commander of
the Turks, became universal through the almost incredible
skill with which, for many years, his handful
of patriots held the mountains of Albania against the
countless armies of the Sultan. His superlative devotion
to his country, was maintained with such sacrifices
as few men have ever rendered to the holiest
cause. He resisted the bribes of riches, power and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
splendor with which the Sultan, baffled by his arms, attempted
to seduce his honor. These things went far to
atone for the treachery of his defection from the Turkish
service.</p>

<p>Upon his arrival in Albania, the citadel of Croia
was given into his hands by the commandant, who was
either unsuspicious of the false order that was sealed
by the now dead hand of the Sultan's secretary, or who
had found that the wily Albanians had already access to
its gates. Sfetigrade and other prominent fortresses
fell rapidly, won by strategy or by the valorous assault
of the patriots. The Albanians had been almost instantaneously
transformed into an invincible army
by the electric thrill which the coming of Castriot
had sent everywhere, from the borders of Macedonia to
the western sea; and by the skill with which that
great captain organized his bands of Epirots and Dibrians.
An army of forty thousand Turks was at one
time divided by his masterly movements, and slain in
detail. A second army met a similar fate. The great
Sultan himself attempted the capture of this Arnaout
"wild beast," as he had learned to call him. One hundred
and fifty thousand men, supplied from the far-reaches
of Asia where the Ottoman made most of his
levies, swarmed like a plague of locusts through the
valleys of Epirus. By sheer momentum of numbers
they pressed their way up to the fortress of Sfetigrade.</p>

<p>The defence of this place is one of the most heroic
in the annals of war or patriotism. As the glacier
melts at the touch of the warm earth in the Alpine valleys
so the mighty army of Amurath dissolved in blood
as it touched the beleaguered walls. At the same time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Scanderbeg, adopting some new expedient in every attack,
made his almost nightly raids through the centre
of the Turkish host, like a panther through the folds of
the sheep, until Amurath cried in sheer vexation among
the generals, "Will none of you save us from the fury
of that wild beast?" The incessant slaughter that
broke the bewildered silence of the generals was the
only response.</p>

<p>Thus passed some six years since the time when
our story opens; years which, had they stood by themselves,
and not been followed by fifteen years more of
equal prowess, would have won for Scanderbeg the unstinted
praise of that distinguished writer who enrolls
him among the seven greatest uncrowned men of the
world's history.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>During these years Castriot had studied with closest
scrutiny the character of his nephew, Amesa. His
natural discernment, aided by his long observation of
human duplicity while among the Turks&mdash;and, indeed
by his own experience, as for many years he had
masked his own discontent and ultimate purpose&mdash;gave
him a power of estimating men which may be called a
moral clairvoyance. He discovered that in his
nephew which led him to credit the story of Kabilovitsch&mdash;as
the forester Arnaud was still called, although
some more than suspected his identity. The chief
saw clearly that Amesa's loyalty would be limited by
his selfish interests. Those interests now led him to
most faithful and apparently patriotic devotion. Besides,
the loss or alienation of so influential a young
voivode, involving a schism in the house of the Castriots,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
might be fatal to the Albanian cause. The general,
therefore, fed the ambition of his relative, giving
him honorable command, for which he was well fitted
by reason of both courage and genius. Nor did
Amesa disappoint this confidence. His sword was
among the sharpest and his deeds most daring. The
peasant soldiers often said that Amesa was not unworthy
the blood of the Castriots. To Sultan Amurath's
proposal of peace on condition of Scanderbeg's
simple recognition of the Ottoman's nominal suzerainty,
allowing him to retain the full actual possession of
all his ancestral holdings, Amesa's voice joined with
that of Moses Goleme and the other allied nobles in
commending the refusal of their chief.</p>

<p>Amesa's courage and zeal seemed at times to pass
the control of his judgment. Thus, in a sharp battle
with the Turks, during the temporary absence of
Castriot, who was resisting an encroachment of the
Venetians on the neighboring country of Montenegro,
the fiery young voivode was seized with such blind
ferocity that he knew not where he was. He had
engaged a group of his own countrymen, apparently
not discerning his mistake until he had unhorsed one
of them, whom he was on the point of sabering, when
his arm was caught by a comrade. The endangered
man was Kabilovitsch, who saw that there was a
method in Amesa's madness which it behoved him to
note.</p>

<p>It was evident to Kabilovitsch not only that he was
recognized by Amesa, but also that the young voivode
was more than suspicious of the former forester's
knowledge of the affair by which the magnificent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
estate of De Streeses had passed into his hands. The
good man's solicitude was intense through fear that
Amesa had become aware of the escape of the child
heir, and might discover some clue to her whereabouts.
Several times Milosch had visited the camp inquiring
for Kabilovitsch; and Constantine had made frequent
journeys carrying tidings of Morsinia's welfare. Had
neither of these been spied upon? Did no one ever
pass the little hamlet where she was in covert who
recognized in the now daily developing womanly features
the likeness of her mother, Mara De Streeses?</p>

<p>A little after this assault of Amesa upon Kabilovitsch,
came news which startled the latter. To understand
this the reader must penetrate a wild mountainous
district a double score of miles from the camp
of Castriot.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ut of a broad valley, through which lies the chief
highway leading to the north-west of Albania,
there opens a narrow ravine which seems to end
abruptly against the precipitous front of a mountain
range. But, turning into this ravine, one is surprised
to find that it winds sharply, following a swift
stream, and climbing for many miles through the
mountain, until it suddenly debouches into a picturesque
valley, which affords grazing space for sheep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
and enough arable land to sustain the peasants who
once dwelt there.</p>

<p>A hamlet nestled in this secluded vale. No road
led beyond it, and it was approached only by the narrow
and tortuous path we have described. A rude
mill sentineled a line of three houses. These dwellings,
though simple in their construction, were quite
commodious. A room of ample dimensions was
enclosed with walls of stone and loam, supporting a
conical roof of thatch. On three sides of this room
and opening into it were smaller chambers, having
detached roofs of their own. The central apartment
was the common gathering place for quite an extensive
community, consisting of a family in three or four
generations; for each son upon marrying brought his
wife to the paternal homestead, and built a new chamber
connecting with the central one. The three houses
contained altogether nearly a hundred souls. The
last of these dwellings was of ampler proportions than
the others, and was occupied by a branch of an ancient
family to which the inhabitants of the other houses
were all of kin. By reason of its antiquity as well as
the comparative wealth of its occupants, it was
regarded as the konak, or village mansion; and the
senior member of its little community was recognized
as the stargeshina, or chief of the village.</p>

<p>It was the latter part of April; the day before that
upon which from time immemorial the peasants among
these mountains had observed the festival of Saint
George, which they devoted to ceremonies commemorative
of the awakening summer life of the world.</p>

<p>It was still early in the afternoon, though the high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
mountain wall on the west had shut out the sun, whose
bright rays, however, still burning far overhead,
dropped their benediction of roseate shadows into the
valley they were not permitted to enter; loading the
atmosphere with as many tints as there were in
Buddha's bowl when the poor man threw in the bud of
genuine charity, and it burst into a thousand flowers.</p>

<p>A group of maidens gathered at the little mill, each
holding an earthen bowl to catch the glistening spray
drops which danced from the edge of the clumsy water-wheel.
When these were filled they cast into the
"witching waters" the early spring flowers, anemones
and violets and white coral arbutus, which they had
picked during the day. It was a pleasing superstition
that the water, having been beaten into spray, received
life from the flowers which the renewed vitality of the
awakening spring spirit had pressed up through the
earth; and that, if one should bathe in this on St.
George's day, health and happiness would attend him
during the year.</p>

<p>"What is it?" cried one as a crackling in the bushes
far above their heads on a steep crag was followed in
a moment by the beat of a pebble, as it glanced from
ledge to ledge almost to their feet.</p>

<p>"The sheep are not up there!" said another.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the Vili!"<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> suggested a third, "for I am
sure that I have seen one this very day."</p>

<p>"What was he like?" exclaimed several at once,
while all kept their eyes upon the cliff above.</p>

<p>"There! there! Did you see it?" Several avowed
that they saw it stealing along the very brow of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
hill; but all agreed that it passed so swiftly that they
could not tell just what they saw.</p>

<p>"It was just so with the one I saw to-day," said the
former speaker. "I was on the ledge by the old
eagle's nest, gathering my flowers. A tall being passed
below me on the path, dressed so beautifully that I
know it was none of us, and had dealings with none of
us. It seemed anxious not to be seen; for my little
cry of surprise caused it to vanish as if it melted into
the foam of the stream as it plunges into the pool."</p>

<p>"That was just like the Vili," interposed one.
"They live under the river's bank. They talk in the
murmur of the streams. Old Mirko, who used to work
much in the mill, learned to understand what they said.
Did this one you saw have long hair? The Vili, Mirko
said, always did."</p>

<p>"I cannot say," replied the girl, "for its head was
hidden in a blossoming laurel bush between it and
me."</p>

<p>"It was one," cried another, "for there are no
blossoming laurels yet. It was its long white hair
waving in the wind, that you saw."</p>

<p>"Let us go down to the pool!" proposed one,
"maybe we can see it again."</p>

<p>"No! No!" cried the others, in a chorus of tremulous
voices.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," said one of the larger girls, "for it
might be they are eating, or they are dancing the
Kolo&mdash;which they always do as the sun goes down,
and if any body sees them then they get angry, and
will come to your house and look at you with the evil
eye."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>Hasting home with their bowls of water crowned
with flowers, they told their story to the stargeshina.</p>

<p>The old man laughed at their credulity:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Girls always see strange things on the eve of
Saint George."</p>

<p>At the evening meal in the great room of the first
house, the patriarch, taking his cue from the story the
girls belonging to that household had told of their
imagined vision, repeated legend after legend about
those strange beings that people the unknown caverns
in the mountains, and rise from the brooks, leaving
the water-spiders to mark the spot where they emerged
so that they may find their way back again, and of the
wjeshtiges, who throw off their bodies as easily as
others lay aside their clothes, flit through the fire, ride
upon the sparks as horses, float on the threads of white
smoke&mdash;all the time watching the persons gathered
about the blazing logs, that they may mark the one
who is first to die. "This doomed person," the old man
said, "they visit when he has gone to sleep, and, with
a magic rod, open his breast; utter in mystic words
the day of his death; take out his heart and feast
upon it. Then they carefully close up the side, and,
though the victim lives on, having no heart, no spring
of life in him, sickens and droops until the fatal day;
as the streams vanish when cut off from the fountains
whence they start."</p>

<p>These stories were followed by songs, the music of
which was within a narrow range of notes, and sung to
the accompaniment of the gusle&mdash;a rude sort of guitar
with a single string. The subjects of these songs and
the ideas they contained were as limited in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
range as the notes by which they were rendered; such
as the impossible exploits of heroes, and improbable
romances of love. The merit of the singing generally
consisted in the additions or variations with which
the genius of the performer enabled him to adorn the
hackneyed music or original narrative.</p>

<p>"Let Constantine take the gusle, and sing us the
song about the peasant maid who conquered the heart
of the king," said the stargeshina.</p>

<p>"Constantine is not here," replied a clear and
sweet, but commanding sort of voice. "He went out
as it began to darken, and has not returned."</p>

<p>The speaker rose as she said it, and went toward
the large door of the room to look out. She was a
young woman of slender, but superb form, which the
costume of the country did not altogether conceal.
She was tall and straight, but moved with the graceful
freedom of a child, for her straightness was not
that of an arrow&mdash;rather of the unstrung bow, whose
beauty is revealed by its flexibility. Her limbs
were rounded perfectly to the feminine model, but
were evidently possessed of muscular strength developed
by daily exercise incident to her mountain life.
A glance at her would disprove that western theory
which associates the ideal of female beauty only with
softness of fleshly texture and lack of sinew. Her face
was commanding, brow high, eyes rather deep-set and
blue, mouth small&mdash;perhaps too straight for the best
expression of amiability&mdash;chin full, and suggestive of
firmness and courage. As she gazed through the
doorway into the night a troubled look knit her features&mdash;just
enough, however, to make one notice rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
the strong, steady and heroic purpose which conquered
it. When she turned again to the company
the firelight revealed only a girlish sweetness and gentleness
of face and manner. She took the gusle and
sang a pretty song about the dancing of the witches;
her merry voice starting a score of other voices in the
simple chorus. Then followed a war song, in which
the daughter of a murdered chieftain calls upon the
clan to avenge her father, and save their land from an
insulting foe. It was largely recitative, and rendered
with so much of the realistic in her tones and manner
as to draw even the old men to their feet, while, with
waving hands and marching stamp, they started the
company in the refrain.</p>

<p>Milosch set the example of retiring when the evening
was well advanced. Though Constantine was
still absent, it gave his father no anxiety, for the boy
was accustomed to have his own private business with
coons in the forest, and the eels in the pool, and, indeed,
with the stars too&mdash;for often he would lie for
hours looking at them, only Morsinia being allowed
to interrupt his conference with the bright-eyed
watchers above.

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>onstantine, who was now a manly fellow of
nearly eighteen years, had left the house when
it grew dark. The night was thick, for heavy clouds
had spread their pall over the sky. A little space
from the house was the kennel. A deep growl
greeted his approach to it.</p>

<p>"Still, Balk!" muttered he, as he loosed an enormous
mastiff, and led the brute toward the side of
the house on which the clijet, or chamber, occupied
by Morsinia was located.</p>

<p>"Down, Balk!" he said, as again and again the
huge beast rose and placed his paws upon his master's
shoulders. Balk was tied within a clump of
elder-bushes a little way from the house, and at the
opening of a foot-path ascending the mountain. The
young man lay down with his head upon the mastiff.
Nearly an hour passed; the silence unbroken except
by a querulous whine of the dog as his comrade
refused to indulge his playful spirit. Suddenly Balk
threw up his head and sniffed the air nervously. Yet
no sound was heard, but the soughing of the winds
through the budding trees, and the murmur of the
brook. The animal became restless and would not
lie down except at the sternly whispered command.</p>

<p>Leaving him, Constantine opened the shutter of the
clijet occupied by his father and himself, and quietly
entered. Though in the dark, he strung a strong bow,
balanced several arrows in his hand to determine the
best, saying to himself as he did so, "I can send these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
straight in the direction of a sound, thanks to my night
hunting!" A dagger was thrust into the top of his
leather hose. He wound his head in the strooka&mdash;the
cloth which answers for both cap and pillow to those
who are journeying among those mountains and liable
to exposure without bed or roof at night.</p>

<p>The noise though slight awakened Milosch, who had
fallen into a light sleep.</p>

<p>"Where now, my boy? No coon will come to you
such a night as this."</p>

<p>"Father, I did not tell you, because you laugh at
my fears," said Constantine in a low tone. "But
the anxiety of Uncle Kabilovitsch and the great captain,
too, when I went to camp last week, makes me
more cautious about Morsinia. The Vili are about,
as the girls said."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, you child! It's a shame that a boy of
your years should believe such stuff. Besides what
have the Vili to do with our daughter?"</p>

<p>"Look here, father; when I was searching for a
rabbit's burrow this afternoon I saw the footprint of
one of them, and it wore a soldier's shoe too. That
is the sort of Vili I believe in."</p>

<p>"Why, boy!" said Milosch, "your head is so full
of soldiering that rabbits' burrows look like soldiers'
feet. Or your head is so turned with love for our
girl, that you must imitate the Latin knights, and go
watch beneath the shutter of your lady's castle. Go,
along, then, and let the night dews take the folly out
of you. Foolish boy!" added he, as he turned toward
the wall.</p>

<p>Constantine went back to the dog. The huge beast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
had thrust himself as far as the cord would allow him
in the direction away from the house, and stood trembling
with excitement as he peered into the black
shadows which lay against the mountain. Constantine
could detect no unusual sound save the creaking
of the gigantic limbs of the trees as they rubbed
against each other in the rising wind, the sharpening
whistle of the breeze, and the crackle of the dead brushwood.
Yet the mastiff's excitement increased. He
strained the rope with his utmost strength, but the
hand of his master upon his neck checked the whining
growl.</p>

<p>A branch snapped on the hillside in the direction of
the path.</p>

<p>"No wind did that," muttered he. A stone rolled
down the declivity.</p>

<p>"No foot familiar with that path did that. You
are right, Balk!" and by main strength he pressed the
mastiff's head to the ground, and, with his arm about
his neck, kept him crouching and silent.</p>

<p>Stealthy steps were heard.</p>

<p>"One! Two!" counted the boy. "You and I are
enough for them, eh, Balk?"</p>

<p>The dog licked the face of his master in token that
he understood, and would take his man if Constantine
would do equally well.</p>

<p>"Three! Four! Five! A large band! Too many
for us, Balk! We must rouse the village&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But at the moment he would have started, his attention
was arrested by low voices almost at his side.</p>

<p>"The clijet nearest. When she is taken I will
sound the bugle call&mdash;the Turkish call, so that your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
dash through the village will be thought to be one of
their dashes. Do as little real damage as you can,
keeping the appearance of a genuine raid; but no
matter if you have to cut the throats of a half-dozen
or more; especially the red-headed fellow you have
seen in camp, and the old devil with the paralyzed
arm. I and Waldy will carry the girl, and wait for
you by the horses on the open road. Let's inspect!"</p>

<p>Two dusky outlines moved toward the house.
Constantine cut the rope, and, at a push of his hand
the dog crawled a few feet until he was clear of the
copse; then sprang into the air. There was a hardly
audible exclamation of surprise and terror; a low
growl of satisfied rage, as when a tiger seizes the food
thrown to him in his cage. One man is down in
death grapple with his strange assailant whose teeth
are at his throat. A sharp whiz and a cry of pain tell
that the arrow of Constantine has not missed its mark.</p>

<p>A second whiz, and the form topples!</p>

<p>The boy stood stupefied with the reaction of the
moment. But the multiplying footfalls along the
ledge aroused him. He darted into the house, swinging
the great bar that turned on a peg in the door
post across the entrance, and thus securing it behind
him. To arouse the household was the work of a
moment. A word explained all. Arms were seized,
not only by the men, but also by the women: for even
to this day a marauder will meet no more skilful and
brave defenders of the villages of Albania than the
wives and daughters who encourage the men by their
example as well as by their words. Their hands are
trained to use the sword, the axe, the dagger; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
the cry of danger transforms the most domestic scene
into an exhibition of Amazons.</p>

<p>The expected attack was delayed. Fears were
excited lest the raiders were about to set fire to the
house. If such were the case, the policy of the
inmates was to sally forth and cut their way through
the assailants, at whatever cost. Some one must go
out. It might be to meet death at the door. Standing
in a circle they hastily repeated the Pater Noster,
each one giving a word in turn; the one to whom the
"Amen" came accepting the appointment as directly
from God. With drawn weapons they gathered at
the door, which was opened suddenly. No enemy
appearing, it was closed, leaving the new sentinel
without.</p>

<p>After going a few paces the guard stumbled over
the dead body of the dog, by the side of which a man
was vainly struggling to rise. Drawing his dagger he
would have completed the work of the mastiff's fangs,&mdash;when
he checked the impulse by better judgment&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, it's better to have him along with us. He'll
come handy before we get through this job!"</p>

<p>So, grasping the two arms of the wounded man in
such a way as to prevent his using a weapon, if
strength enough should remain, he swung the helpless
hulk upon his back, as he had often carried the carcass
of a wolf down the mountain; and, giving the
preconcerted signal at the door, was instantly re-admitted.</p>

<p>The wounded man wore the Turkish uniform, and
was evidently the officer in charge of the raiding
party. This fact sufficiently explained the delay in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
following up the attack, for doubtless his men were
still waiting for the order which he would never
give.</p>

<p>"We must rouse our neighbors," said the old man,
who was recognized as the commandant of the dwelling,
and obeyed as such with that reverence for
seniority which is to this day a beautiful characteristic
of the Albanian people.</p>

<p>Constantine held a hurried, but confidential talk
with Milosch, who proposed that Constantine and
his sister should undertake the hazardous venture of
alarming the next house. All remonstrated against
Morsinia's venturing, the patriarch refusing to allow
it. Milosch persuaded him with these words, which
were not overheard by the others&mdash;</p>

<p>"She is the chief object of attack; this I have discovered.
If she remains in the house she will be captured.
Her only safety is to leave it, and disappear
in the darkness. Once out there she can hide near
by, or can thread her way up among the crags, where
no stranger's foot will ever come. She knows every
stone and tree in the dark as well as a mole knows the
twists and turns of his burrow."</p>

<p>Morsinia caught at once the spirit of the adventure,
and in her eagerness preceded Constantine to the
doorway. The thrill of fear on her account gave way
to a thrill of applause for her as she stood in readiness.
She had donned a helmet of thick half-tanned
hides, and a corsage of light iron links, looped together
and tied with leathern thongs, about her person.
Her arms were left free for the use of the bow and
stock which swung from her shoulder, and the klaptigan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
or short dagger, which hung in the plaits of her
kilt.</p>

<p>"The Holy Virgin protect her!" was the prayer
which came from all sides as she flung her arms about
the neck of Milosch, and as she afterward bowed her
head to receive the kiss of the patriarch upon her
forehead. The light in the room was extinguished
that their exit might not be noted by any without
when the door should open.</p>

<p>For a moment Constantine and Morsinia stood close
to the door which had closed behind them. Their
keen hearing detected the fact that the house was
surrounded, though by persons stationed at a distance,
chiefly upon the higher slopes of the hills. The road
to the next house was evidently guarded.</p>

<p>Constantine insisted upon Morsinia's concealing
herself rather than attempting to go with him to the
neighbors; but only after remonstrance with him did
she consent to his plan. Silently crossing the road,
and without so much as breaking a stick or rustling a
dead leaf beneath her feet&mdash;a dexterity acquired in
approaching the timid game with which the mountains
abounded, and which she had often hunted&mdash;she
disappeared in the dense copse.</p>

<p>Constantine moved cautiously by the wayside, easily
eluding the notice of the men whose dark outlines
were discerned by him as they stood on guard at
intervals along the road. He had nearly approached
the neighboring house when the still night air was rent
with the shrill note of a Turkish bugle call from the
direction of the dwelling they had left.</p>

<p>"Could it be that the captured officer had recovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
sufficient reason and strength to break from his captors
and give the signal?" thought Constantine. The
call sounded again&mdash;it was evidently from a distance,
beyond the village. A score or more dim forms at
the sound gathered in the road; some emerging from
the bushes near, others descending from points high
up the slopes on either side&mdash;their hurried but
muffled conversation showed that they were about
to make the appointed dash upon the doomed dwelling.
But a second blare of trumpets sounded far
down toward the entrance of the valley, followed by a
clanging of armor and clatter of horses' feet. Torches
glared far away. A party was evidently just winding
out of the defile into the open space where the hamlet
stood. Rescuers doubtless! for the first party of
raiders scattered to right and left, and were heard
climbing again up the wooded slopes. Morsinia
hastened to Constantine, and together they hurried to
meet the new comers. But they were not rescuers.
They attacked the house with shouts of "Allah!
Allah!" They fired it with their torches. Some
poured along the road toward the next house.</p>

<p>They were genuine Turks. Unable to conquer
Scanderbeg in battle, the great army had spread
everywhere to lay waste the country. In fertile
meadows, along every stream, wherever a castle or
chalet was known to be, raged the numberless soldiers,
who, beaten in nobler fight, sought vengeance by
becoming murderers of the more helpless, and kidnappers
of women and children to fill their harems.</p>

<p>With flying feet Constantine and Morsinia outstripped
the riders, alarmed the second house, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
ran to the third. Behind them the crackling flames
told that it was too late to return. All who could
escape gathered at the great konak. Since a similar
raid, some years before, this building had been converted
into a rude fortification. The wall which surrounded
it, as an enclosure for sheep and cattle, had
been built up high and strong enough to prevent any
approach to the main structure by an anticipated foe,
except as the scalers of the wall should be exposed to
the missiles of those within. The konak proper was
pierced with loop-holes, through which a shower of
arrows could be poured by unseen archers.</p>

<p>The court was already filled with the fugitives,
while some had entered the building, when it was surrounded
by the Turks. Constantine had gained from
Morsinia a promise to avoid exposure; and had
agreed upon a place of meeting on the mountain, in
the event of their both surviving the conflict. But the
eagerness of Constantine overcame his discretion, and,
heading a group of peasants who had not been able to
enter the konak, he mingled in a hand-to-hand fight
with the assailants. Morsinia's interest led her to
closely watch the fray from the bordering thicket,
changing her position from time to time that she might
not lose sight of the well-known form of her foster-brother.
Seeing him endangered, she could not resist
the vain impulse to fly to his assistance; as if her
arms could stay those of the stout troopers who surrounded
him; or as if a Turk could have respect for
a woman's presence. Scarcely had she moved from
her covert when strong hands seized her, and, by a
quick movement, pinioned her arms behind her back.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>"Ho! man, guard this girl! If my houri escapes,
your head shall be forfeit," cried her captor, an officer,
to a common soldier who was holding his horse. In a
moment he was lost to sight in the struggling throng.</p>

<p>The wall was carried, and, though many a turban
had rolled from the lifeless head of its wearer, the
building was finally fired&mdash;life being promised to the
women who should surrender. Some of these, who
were young, were thrust from the door by their kindred,
who preferred for them the chances of miserable
existence as Turkish prey, to seeing them perish with
themselves. Most, however, fought to the last by the
side of their husbands and fathers, and were slain in
the desperate attempt to make their way from the
flames which drove them out.</p>

<p>Constantine, by strange strength and skill, extricated
himself from the mêlée. A sharp flesh wound
cooled his blind rage; and, realizing that another's
life, as dear to him as his own, was involved in his
safety, he withdrew from the danger, and sought
Morsinia.</p>

<p>Not finding her during the night, he returned in
the earliest dawn to the konak. The building was in
ruins; the ground strewn with dead and wounded.
With broken hearts the few who had escaped were
bewailing their loved ones killed or missing. But
there was no tidings of Morsinia. In vain the woods
were searched; every old trysting place sacred to
some happy memory of the years they had spent
together&mdash;the eagle's crag, the cave in the ravine,
the dense copse. But only memories were there.
Imagination supplied the rest&mdash;a horrid imagination!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
The poor boy was maddened and crushed; at one
moment a fiend; at the next almost lifeless with grief.</p>

<p>An examination at the lower house discovered the
body of his father, Milosch. He had been killed outside
the house; for his body, though terribly gashed,
was not burned, as were those found within the walls
of the building.</p>

<p>Constantine had, up to this time, regarded himself
as a boy; now he felt that he was a man, with more
of life in its desirableness behind than ahead of him:
a desperate man, with but a single object to live for,
vengeance upon the Turk, and upon those who, worse
than Turks, of Albanian blood, had first attempted
Morsinia's capture.</p>

<p>Yet there was another thing to live for. Perhaps
she might be recaptured. Improbable, but not impossible!
That, then, should be his waking dream. Such
a hope&mdash;hope against hope&mdash;was all that could make
life endurable, except it were to drain the blood of
her captors.</p>

<p>He was driven by the poignancy of his grief and
the hot fury of his rage, to make this double object
an immediate pursuit. He felt that he could not
sleep again until he had tasted some of the vengeance
for which he thirsted.</p>

<p>But how could he accomplish it? He must lay his
plan, for it were worse than useless to start single-handed
without one. He must plot his tragedy before
he began to execute it.</p>

<p>He sat down amid the ruins of the hamlet&mdash;amid
the ruins of his happiness and hopes&mdash;to plot. But
he could devise nothing. His attempts were like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
writing on the air. He sat in half stupor; his power
to think crushed by the dead weight of mingled grief
and the sense of impotency.</p>

<p>But suddenly he started&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fool! fool, that I am, to waste the moments!
This very night it may be done."</p>

<p>He hastily stripped the body of a dead Turkish soldier,
and, rolling the uniform into a compact bundle,
plunged with it through the thicket and up the steep
mountain side.</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he valley in which the little hamlet lay, as well as
the ravine by which it was approached, was exceedingly
tortuous. The stream which seemed to
have made these in its ceaseless windings, sometimes
almost doubled upon itself, as if the spirit of the
waters were the prey of the spirit of the hills that
closed in upon its path, and thus it sought to elude
its pursuer. Though it was fully twenty miles from
the demolished konak to where the narrow valley
debouched into the open plain, it was not more than
a quarter of this distance in a straight line between
those points. The interjacent space was, however,
impassable to any except those familiar with its trackless
rocks. From a distance the mountain lying
between seemed a sheer precipice. But Constantine
knew every crevice up which a man could climb; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
various ledges that were connected, if not by balconies
broad enough for the foot, at least by contiguous
trunks of trees, balustrades of tough mountain laurel,
or ropes of wild vine. He could cross this wall of
rock in an hour or two, but the Turkish raiders would
occupy the bulk of the day in making the circuit of
the road. Indeed they would in all probability not
leave the security of the great ravine, and strike the
highway, until night-fall; for the terror of Scanderbeg's
ubiquity was always before the Turks. It was
this thought that had prompted Constantine's sudden
action when he started up from his despairing reverie
amid the embers of his home.</p>

<p>It was still early in the afternoon when, having
passed with the celerity of a goat among the crags,
he looked down from the further side of the great barrier
upon the Turkish company. He stood upon a
ledge almost above their heads; and never did an
eagle's eye take in a brood upon which he was about
to swoop, more sharply than did Constantine's observe
the details of the camp below him.</p>

<p>There were the horses tethered. Yonder was a
group of officers playing at dice. In a circle of
guards beyond, a few women and children; and
among them&mdash;could he mistake that form?</p>

<p>The soldiers were preparing their mess. Some were
picking the feathers from fowls; others building fires.
Then his surmise had been correct, that they would
not leave the valley until night.</p>

<p>Constantine donned the Turkish uniform he had
brought with him, and climbed down the mountain.
Sentinels were posted here and there upon bold points
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
from which they might get a view of the great plain
beyond. Toward this they kept a constant watch, as
one of them remarked to his comrade upon a neighboring
pinnacle of rock: "Lest some of Scanderbeg's
lightning might be lying about loose." Posing like a
sentinel whenever he was likely to be observed, Constantine
passed through their lines, the guards being
too far apart to detect one another's faces. Hailed by
a sentinel, he gave back the playful salute with a wave
of his hand.</p>

<p>Emboldened by the success of his disguise, he descended
to a ledge so near the group of officers that
he could easily hear their conversation. They did not
use the pure Turkish speech, but sometimes interspersed
it with Servian, for many of the officers, as
well as the men, in the Sultan's armies were from the
provinces where the Turkish tongue was hardly
known. The common soldiers in this group Constantine
observed used the Servian altogether.</p>

<p>"Good!" said he to himself, "point number one in
my plot."</p>

<p>"The highest throw wins the choice of the captives,"
cried one of the officers. "What say you, Oski?"</p>

<p>"Agreed," replied the one addressed, "but she will
never be your houri in paradise, Lovitsch?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because the Koran forbids casting lots?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied his comrade. "I will take my beauty
now, in this world, rather than wait for the next. So
here goes!"</p>

<p>"By Khalif Omar's big toe! You have won, Oski.
Which will you take?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<p>"The little one with the bright black eyes," replied
Oski; "unless you can prevail upon Captain Ballaban
to give me his. The man who owns that girl will
never have any houris in paradise. They would all
die for jealousy."</p>

<p>"Captain Ballaban is his name," murmured Constantine
to himself. "Good! Point number two in my
plot."</p>

<p>"I would not have her for a gift," said Lovitsch,
"for she has a strange eye&mdash;the evil eye perhaps&mdash;at
least there is something in it I cannot fathom. She
looks straight through a man. I touched her under
the chin, when those gentle blue orbs burst with fire.
There was as much of a change in her as there is in
one of our new-fashioned cannon when it is touched
off; quiet one moment, and sending a bullet through
you the next. She's the daughter of the devil, sure."</p>

<p>"You are a bold soldier, Lovitsch, to be afraid of a
girl," laughed his comrade. "I would like the chance
of owning that beauty. If I could not manage her I
could sell her. She would bring a bag of gold at
Adrianople. Captain Ballaban will probably give her
as a present to Prince Mahomet. He can afford to do
so, for the prince has shown him wonderful favors.
Think of a young Janizary, who has not seen nineteen
summers, with a captain's rank, and commanding such
greybeards as we!"</p>

<p>"No doubt the prince favors him," replied Lovitsch,
"but that will not account for his advance in the Janizary's
corps. Nothing but real grit and genius gets
ahead among those fellows. The prince can give his
jewels and gold, but he could not secure a Janizary's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
promotion to a soldier any more than he could bring
him to disgrace without the consent of the Aga. No,
comrade, Ballaban was born a soldier, and has won
every thread in his captain's badge by some exploit or
sage counsel. But I wish he was back with us. I like
not being left in charge of such a motley troop as this.
If Scanderbeg should close up the mouth of this ravine
with a few score of his spavined cavalry, we would be
like so many eggs in a bag, to be smashed together,
without Ballaban's wit to get us out."</p>

<p>"I think the captain has returned, for, if I mistake
not, I saw his red head a little while ago glowing like
a sunset on the crag yonder," replied Oski, looking up
toward the spot where Constantine was sitting.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;"Good! said Constantine, holding his council
of war with his own thoughts. "The captain looks
like me before sunset. Perhaps I can look like him
after sunset. One advantage of having a head tiled
in red! But I will not show it again. Point number
three in my plot."&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Quite likely the captain has returned, and is
prowling about, inspecting everything, from the
horses'-tails to our very faces, that he may read our
thoughts. That is his way," said Lovitsch, glancing
around.</p>

<p>"Which way did he go?"</p>

<p>"You might as well ask which track the Prophet's
horse took through the air when he carried his rider
on the night journey to heaven. A messenger from the
chief Aga met him just as we were finishing the fight
last night, and, with a word turning over the command
to me, he mounted his horse and was off.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
Perhaps he heads some other raid to-night; or, for
aught I know, may be conferring with Scanderbeg in
the disguise of a Frankish general; for that Ballaban's
brain is as prolific of schemes and tricks as this ant's
nest is full of eggs"&mdash;turning over a stone as he
spoke.</p>

<p>The afternoon waned, and, as the night fell, preparations
were made for the march. When it was
dark a light bugle note called in the sentinels, and the
company moved forward.</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the gathering gloom Constantine approached the
extreme edge of the camp, where those who were
to bring up the rear had just mounted. A soldier,
somewhat separated from the others, was leading
several horses; either a relay in case of accident to
the others, or those animals whose saddles had been
emptied during the fight at the konak. Constantine's
appearance was evidently a surprise to the soldier, who
eyed him closely, but made no movement indicating
suspicion beyond that of a rather pleased curiosity.
The man made a low salâm, bowing his turban to the
saddle bow, and addressed him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you not mount, Sire?" Without responding
Constantine leaped into a saddle.</p>

<p>"You will pardon me, Captain," continued the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
soldier. "You are welcome back, for we are in better
heart when you are with us."</p>

<p>"Thanks, good fellow," said Constantine, "but I
have not returned yet&mdash;at least my return must not be
known to the troops until the morning. We will take
your tongue out if you tell any one I am back
without bidding."</p>

<p>The man gave a quick glance as if perplexed.
Constantine's hand was upon his dagger. But the
soldier's doubt was relieved as he seemed to be confident
of the familiar form of his captain; and he
explained his apparent suspicion by quickly adding&mdash;</p>

<p>"You speak the Servian excellent well, Captain."</p>

<p>"One must get used to it, and every other tongue,
in commanding such a mixed crew as the Sultan
gathers into his army," said Constantine.</p>

<p>"You Janizaries are wonderful men," replied the
soldier. "You know all languages. There was the
little Aga I once"&mdash;</p>

<p>"No matter about that now," said Constantine,
interrupting him. "I want you for a special duty.
Can I trust you to do me an errand? If you do it
well you will be glad of it hereafter."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, Sire! with my life; and my lips as
mute as the horse's."</p>

<p>"I captured a girl last night. She knows something
I would find out by close questioning. I must have
her brought to the rear."</p>

<p>"Ay! the girl Koremi holds?"</p>

<p>"Yes, tell Koremi to loiter a little with her until
I come up. We must not go far from this defile before
I find out what she knows, if I have to discover it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
with my dagger in her heart; for there are traitors
among us. Last night there were Arnaouts dressed
as Moslems in the fight."</p>

<p>"That I know," said the soldier, "for I tripped
over a fellow myself, hiding in the bushes, who swore
at me in as good round Arnaout tongue as they speak
in hell. I ran him through and found a Giaour corslet
under his jacket. If there are traitors among us
we will broil them over our first camp-fire, that they
may scent hell before they get there."</p>

<p>"You see then why I must find out what I can at
once," said the assumed captain. "Some of our men
are in league with the Arnaouts. I can find out from
that girl every one of them. Impress this upon
Koremi; and if he hesitates to let the girl drift to the
rear, you can tell him that he will be suspected of
being in league with the rascals."</p>

<p>Constantine took the ropes which held the horses
the man was leading; and, bidding him to haste, but
be cautious that no one but Koremi should know the
message, followed slowly behind.</p>

<p>It was nearly an hour later when the form of the
soldier appeared in the road just before him.</p>

<p>"Right!" said Constantine.</p>

<p>"Right!" was the response, first to the assumed
captain, then repeated to some one behind him. Two
other forms appeared; one of them a woman.</p>

<p>Anticipating his orders, the second trooper untied
a rope from about his own waist, and handed it,
together with the rein of the horse the woman rode, to
Constantine. Then, making a low obeisance, the two
troopers withdrew a little distance to the rear.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<p>The other end of the rope which Constantine held
was about the waist of the captive. Drawing the led
horse close to his own, and dropping his turban more
over his face, Constantine closely scrutinized the
features of the woman. She was Morsinia. It was
difficult for him to repress the excitement and delay
the revelation of his true person, but the hazard of the
least cry of surprise or recognition on her part nerved
him to coolness.</p>

<p>"Where are you taking me? If you have the courage,
kill me," said the girl.</p>

<p>Constantine replied only by whistling a snatch of
an Albanian air.</p>

<p>"Are you an Albanian renegade?" continued the
girl. "Could you not be content to sell yourself to
fight for the Turk against other enemies, but must be
a double traitor, and kill and kidnap your own
kind?"</p>

<p>The whistling continued. But as the soldiers were
a little removed, he said in a low voice, disguising his
natural tones:</p>

<p>"I am an Albanian, and if you will not speak, but
only obey, I can save you."</p>

<p>"Jesu grant you are true!" was the tremulous
response.</p>

<p>"This will prove it," muttered he, reaching toward
her, and with his knife cutting a broad strap which
bound her limbs to the saddle. "If tied elsewhere,
here is the knife."</p>

<p>The way, which had been narrowed by the projection
of the mountains on either side, now widened
a little. Constantine knew the spot well. There had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
once been a mill and peasant's hut there, and now
quite a plat of grass was growing from the soft soil.
The eye could not discern it, for the darkness was
rayless. But Constantine remembered the grassy
stretch was just round the point of rock they were
passing. The horses were walking slowly, being
allowed by their riders to pick their way along the
stony road. As they turned the rock a strong wind
rushed through the ravine, wailing a requiem over the
now deserted settlement and the dead leaves of last
year, which it whirled in eddies; and singing a lullaby
through the trees to the new-born leaves of the spring
time, which were rocked on the cradling branches.
This, together with the clatter of the horses' feet before
and behind them, enabled Constantine to draw the
captive's horse and his own upon the soft turf without
being heard. Halting them at a few yards' distance,
they allowed the men who had followed them to pass
by, and sat in silence until the lessening sound told
them that the soldiers had made another turn in the
road. Then, wheeling the horses, Constantine gave
loose rein back over the track they had come. After
a short ride he dismounted, and closely examining the
way, led the horses to one side, up a path, and down
again to a little plateau, perhaps a furlong from the
main road, where a grazing patch would keep them
from being betrayed by the neighing. He dreaded
the fatigue of further journey to his comrade; for
even his own ordinarily tireless frame was beginning
to feel the drain of the terrible night and day they
had passed through.</p>

<p>Constantine threw off his turban and stretched his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
strong arms to lift the captive from her horse, exclaiming
with delight in his own familiar tones,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am no Albanian, dear Morsinia, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Constantine!" she cried.</p>

<p>He laid an almost lifeless form upon the turf, for
the shock of the revelation had been too much for her
jaded nerves and excited brain. Unrolling the cloth
of his turban he spread it over her person, while his
own breast was her pillow. Slowly she recovered
strength and self-command.</p>

<p>In a few words the mutual stories of the hours of
their separation were told. Morsinia had been treated
with exceeding kindness and respect, as the captive of
the chief officer of the expedition, who seemed to be
a person of some distinction, though she had not seen
him. Constantine insisted upon his companion's seeking
sleep, but by his inquiries, did as much as her own
thoughts to keep her awake; so that at the dawn they
confessed that the eyes of neither had been closed.
The necessity of procuring food led them to start at
daybreak for the nearest settlement. They descended
to the road and retraced the course of the preceding
night; for it was useless to return to the wrecked
hamlet. They had gone but a short distance when
they heard the sound of a body of cavalry directly in
front of them, riding rapidly up the valley. There
was no time to avoid the approaching riders either by
flight or concealment. Constantine said hastily,</p>

<p>"Remember, if they are Turks, I too am a Turk,
and you are my captive. If they are friends, all is
well. Stay where you are, and I will ride forward to
meet them."
</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he newcomers proved to be a detachment of
Albanians. Constantine was instantly captured
notwithstanding his declaration that his dress was
only assumed.</p>

<p>"Aha! you are a Christian now in a Turk's skin,
are you? But yesterday you were a Turk in a Christian's
feathers," was the taunt with which he was
greeted by one of the foremost riders, who continued
his bantering. "Your face is honest, if your heart is
not, you Moslem devil; for your ugly features will not
lie though your tongue does. I would know that
square jaw and red head equally well now, were it
under the tiara of the pope instead of under the turban;
and I would cut your throat if you carried St.
Peter's key in your girdle; you change-skinned
lizard!"</p>

<p>"Who is he?" cried the horsemen, gathering
about.</p>

<p>"Why! the very knave who escaped us about sundown
yesterday, after spying our camp; and he has
the impudence to ask us to take him prisoner that he
may spy us again."</p>

<p>"Let us hamstring him!" cried another, "and,
unless St. Christopher has turned Moslem in paradise
and helps the rascal, he will find no legs to run
away with again."</p>

<p>"Set him up for a mark when we halt," proposed a
third. "A ducat to him whose arrow can split his ear
without tearing the cheek at forty paces!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>Constantine was helpless as they adjusted a halter
about his neck, with which to lead him at the side of
a horseman, the butt of the scurrilous wit and sharper
spear-points of his half mad and half merry captors.</p>

<p>They had gone but a few paces when the colonel
commanding the detachment made his way through
the troopers to the front. He was a venerable man
with long flowing white beard. His bodily strength
seemed to come solely from the vitality of
nerve and the dominance of his spirit; for he was well
worn with years.</p>

<p>"What is this noise about?" he asked sternly.</p>

<p>Before any could reply he stared with a moment's
incredulity and wonder at Constantine, who relieved his
doubts by recognizing him.</p>

<p>"Colonel Kabilovitsch!" cried he, doffing his turban
as if it had been a Christian cap.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> "Your men are
playful fellows, as frolicksome as a cat with a mole."</p>

<p>"But why are you here, my boy? and why this
disguise?" interrupted Kabilovitsch.</p>

<p>The explanation was given in a few words;&mdash;on
the one side the story of the slaughter at the village,
and the adventures of Morsinia and Constantine; on
the other of how the news of the Turkish raid reached
the camp at Sfetigrade about noon, and the rescuing
party had started at once under Kabilovitsch's command,
and ridden at breakneck speed during the
entire night in the hope of meeting the Turks before
they emerged from the narrow valley.</p>

<p>Learning now that they were too late for this,
Kabilovitsch halted his command, and with Constantine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
sought the place where Morsinia was in waiting.
When the old man heard that the first assailants of the
hamlet had been Albanians in disguise his rage was
furious; and through his incautious words Morsinia
learned more of her relation to the voivode Amesa
than her reputed father had ever told her; for the
mystery of her family had never been fully explained in
her hearing. It had heretofore been deemed best that
the girl should not be made the custodian of her own
secret, lest her childish prattle might reveal it to
others. Yet she had guessed the greater part of the
problem of her identity. But Kabilovitsch was now
led by the new curiosity which his inadvertent expressions
had awakened in her, as well as by the remarkably
discreet and cautious judgment she had displayed,
to tell her the entire story of her own life. This was
not, however, until orders had been passed through
the troop for rest, and the fires hastily kindled along
the roadside had prepared their refreshing breakfasts.</p>

<p>Removed from the hearing of all others, Kabilovitsch
rehearsed to Morsinia and Constantine what
the reader already knows of her extraction and early
residence in Albania. He advised her to extreme
caution against the slightest reference to herself as
the young Mara de Streeses, and that she should
insist upon her identity as the daughter of the Servian
peasant Milosch and the sister of Constantine.</p>

<p>Morsinia buried her fair face in the gray beard of
the old man, as years ago she had done when they
sat upon the door-stone of their Balkan home, and
sobbed as if his words had orphaned her. In a few
moments she looked up into his fine but wrinkled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
face, and drawing it down to hers, kissed him as she
used to do, and said lovingly,</p>

<p>"I must believe your words; but my heart holds
you as my father: for father you have been to me,
and child I shall be to you so long as God gives us to
one another."</p>

<p>The old man pressed her temples between his
rough hands, and looked long into her deep blue eyes,
as he said slowly,</p>

<p>"Ay, father and mother both was I to thee, my
child, from that terrible night, sixteen years ago. My
rough arms have often cradled thee. But now you
have a nobler and stronger protector in our country's
father, the great Castriot. To him you must go; for
it is no longer safe in these lonely valleys. Under his
strong arm and all-watchful eye you will be amply protected.
There are nameless enemies of the old house
of De Streeses whom we must avoid as vigilantly as
we avoid the Turks."</p>

<p>It was determined that Constantine should make a
detour with her, and approach Sfetigrade from the
south, giving out that they were fugitives from the
lower country, which the enemy had also been
raiding.</p>

<p>The colonel stated to his under officers, in hearing
of the men, that the young Turk was really one of
Castriot's scouts, and that the young woman was an
accomplice. Borrowing from one and another sufficient
Albanian costumes to substitute for Constantine's
disguise, Kabilovitsch dismissed the couple.</p>

<p>There was no end to the badgering the officious
soldier who had first arrested the scout received at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
hands of his comrades. They jeered at his double
mistake in taking the fellow yesterday as a Turkish spy
in Albanian uniform, because he had slipped away so
shrewdly, and now again being duped by him a real
Albanian in Turkish disguise. Some threw the halter
over the fellow's neck; others made mimic preparation
for hamstringing him; while one presented him
with an immense scroll of bark purporting to be his
commission as chief of the department of secret service,
finishing the mock presentation by shivering the
bark over the fellow's head. The unhappy man contented
himself philosophically:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No wonder General Castriot baffles the enemy
when his own men cannot understand him. You were
all as badly twisted by that fellow's tricks as I was. But
I will never interfere with that red head again, though
he wears a turban and is cutting the throat of the
general himself."</p>

<p>Two days later a beautiful girl accompanied by her
brother&mdash;who was as unlike her as the thorn bush is
unlike the graceful flowering clematis that festoons its
limbs, both of them in apparent destitution, refugees
from near the Greek border&mdash;entered the town of
Sfetigrade. By order of the general, to whom their
piteous story was told by Kabilovitsch&mdash;for he had
chanced, so he said, to come upon them as they were
inquiring their way to the town&mdash;they were quartered
with a family whose house was not far from the citadel.
For some weeks the girl was an invalid. A raging
fever had been induced by over excitement and the
subsequent fatigue of the long journey. Colonel
Kabilovitsch could not refrain from expressing his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
interest in the young woman by almost daily calls at
the cottage where she lay. One day, when it was
supposed by the surgeon that she might not live, the
old man was observed to stand long at the cot upon
which the sick girl was lying. A look of agony overspread
his features when the surgeon, who had been
feeling her pulse, laid her almost nerveless hand
beneath the blanket.</p>

<p>"Dear, good old man," said the housewife. "I
warrant he has laid some pretty one of his own in the
ground. Maybe a child, or a lover, sometime back in
the years. These things do come to us over and over
again."</p>

<p>The brother of the sick girl scarcely noticed the
visits of Colonel Kabilovitsch, except to respond to
his questions when no one but himself could give the
exact information about the patient's condition; for
none watched with her so incessantly.</p>

<p>But her marvellous natural vitality enabled the
sufferer to outlive the fever; and, as she became convalescent,
the old colonel seemed to forget her. His
interest was apparently in her suffering rather than in
herself.

<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he battlements of Sfetigrade lay, like a ruffled
collar, upon enormous shoulders of rock rising
high above the surrounding country. Over them rose,
like a massive head, the citadel with its bartizans projecting
as a crown about the brow. The rock upon
which the fortification stood was scarped toward the
valley, so that it could be climbed only with the help
of ladders, even though the assailants were unresisted
by its defenders. The few spots which nature had
left unguarded were now choked with abattis, or
overlooked by bastions so skilfully constructed as to
need far less courage and strength for their defence
than were possessed by the bands of Dibrian and
Epirot patriots who fought from behind them.</p>

<p>The assaults which Sultan Amurath launched
against the place had been as frequent as the early
summer showers, and his armies were beaten to pieces
as the rain rebounded in spray and ran in streams
from the rocks. The chagrin of the baffled Sultan
reflected itself in the discouragement of his generals
and the demoralization of their men. The presence of
his majesty could not silence the mutual recriminations,
the loud and rancorous strife with which brave
officers sought to lay upon one another the responsibility
for their defeat, rather than confess that the
daily disasters were due to the superior genius commanding
among their foes. Especially was the envy
of the leaders of the other corps and branches of the
service excited against the Janizaries, to whose unrivalled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
training and daring were due whatever minor
victories had been won, and whatever exploits worthy
of mention had been performed.</p>

<p>A lofty tent, whose projecting centre-pole bore the
glittering brass crescent and star, and before the
entrance to which a single horse-tail hung from the
long spear, denoted the headquarters of a Sanjak Bey.
In front of the tent walked two men in eager, and not
altogether amiable, conversation. The one was the
Bey, whose huge turban of white, inwound with green,
indicated that his martial zeal was supplemented by
equal enthusiasm for his faith; and that he had added
to the fatigue of many campaigns against the infidels
the toil of a more monotonous, though more satisfactory,
pilgrimage to Mecca. His companion was an
Aga of the Janizaries, second only in rank to the chief
Aga.</p>

<p>The latter was speaking with a wrath which his
courteous words but ill concealed&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do not impugn your honor or the sincerity of
your motives, Caraza-Bey, in making your accusation
against our Captain Ballaban; but the well-known
jealousy which is everywhere manifested against our
corps compels me to believe not a single word to the
discredit of him or any of the Yeni-Tscheri without indubitable
proof. I would allow the word of Captain
Ballaban&mdash;knowing him so well as I do&mdash;to outweigh
the oaths on the Koran of a score of those who, like
yourself, have reason to be jealous of his superior
courage."</p>

<p>"But your upstart captain's guilt can be proved, if
not to your personal satisfaction, at least before those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
who will not care to ask your assent to their judgment,"
replied the other, not attempting to veil his
hatred of the Aga, any more than his purpose of
crushing the one of whom they were speaking.</p>

<p>"What will the lies of a whole sanjak of your hirelings
avail against the honor of a Janizary?" replied
the Aga. "If two horse-tails<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> hung from the standard
yonder, I would not publicly disgrace Captain Ballaban
by so much as ordering an inquiry at your
demand. The Janizaries will take no suggestion from
any but the Padishah."</p>

<p>"A curse on the brag of the Janizaries! The arrogancy
of the Christian renegades needs better warrant
than Ballaban can give it," sneered the Bey. "If you
like, let the matter rest as it is. The whole army
believes that one of your dervish-capped heroes&mdash;the
best of the brood, I imagine&mdash;deserted his comrades
in battle, and all for the sake of a captive girl."</p>

<p>"It is a lie!" shouted the Aga, drawing his sword
upon him.</p>

<p>The attitude of the two officers drew a crowd, who
rushed from all sides to witness the duel. Both were
masters of sword play, so that neither obtained any
sanguinary advantage before they were separated by
the arrival of the chief Aga, who forbade his subaltern
to continue the conflict. Upon hearing the occasion
of the affray, the chief said:</p>

<p>"The trial of Captain Ballaban shall be had, with
the publication of the fact that Caraza-Bey has
assumed the position of his accuser; and, in the event
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
of his charge proving false, he shall atone for his
malice by submitting to any punishment the captain
may indicate; and the force of the Janizaries shall
execute it, though they cut the throats of his entire
command in order to do it. We must first vindicate
the honor of the corps, and then take vengeance upon
its detractors. I demand that Caraza-Bey make good
his charge to-morrow at the sixth hour, or accept the
judgment of coward and vilifier, which our court shall
then proclaim to the army."</p>

<p>At the appointed time on the day following, the tent
of the chief Aga was the gathering place of the notable
officers of the corps. Without, it differed from
hundreds of other tents only in its size, and in the
pennant indicating the rank of its occupant. Within,
it was lined with a canopy of finest silk and woollen
tapestries, on the blue background of which crescents
and stars, cimeters and lance-heads, battle-axes,
shields, turbans and dervish caps were artistically
grouped with texts from the Koran, and skilfully
wrought in braids and threads of gold. The canvas
sides of the tent were now removed, making it an open
pavilion, and inviting inspection and audience from
any who desired to approach. A divan was at one
side, and made a semicircle of about half the tent.
Upon this sat the chief Aga, his cushion slightly raised
above those at his side, which were occupied by the
agas of lower rank. A group of officers filled the
space beneath the tent; and soldiers of all grades
made a dense crowd for several rods beyond into the
open air.</p>

<p>The chief Aga waved his hand to an attendant, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
the military court was formally opened. Several cases
were disposed of before that of Captain Ballaban was
called.</p>

<p>There was led in a stalwart soldier of middle age.
Two witnesses deposed that, in a recent assault upon
the enemy's works at Sfetigrade, when there was
poured upon the assailants a shower of arrows and
stones from the battlements above, this man, without
orders from his officer, had cried, "Give way! Give
way!" and that to this cry and his example were due
the confusion of ranks and the retreat which followed.</p>

<p>The chief Aga turned and looked silently upon the
man, awaiting his reply to the accusation. The
accused was speechless. The chief then turned to
the Aga to whose division the culprit belonged, that he
might hear any plea that he should be pleased to offer
for the soldier; but the Aga's face was stolid with
indifference. The chief, without raising his head, sat
in silence for a moment, as in solemn act of weighing
the case. He then muttered an invocation of Allah
as the Supreme Judge. He paused. A gleam of
light circled above the man; a hissing sound of the
cimeter and a thud were heard. The culprit's head
rolled to the ground. His trunk swayed for an instant
and fell.</p>

<p>This scene was apparently of little interest to the
spectators. A second case only tested their patience.
One was charged with having failed to deliver an order
from the colonel of his orta, or regiment, to a captain
of one of the odas, or companies. Both these officers
testified, the one to having sent the order, the other
to not having received it, and on this account to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
have failed to occupy a certain position with his
men in a recent engagement with the enemy. The
culprit alleged that it was impossible to deliver the
order because of the enemy's movements at the time.
The Aga of the division, being appealed to by the silent
gaze of the judge, simply said:</p>

<p>"The man is brave;" when, by a motion of the
hand, the judge dismissed the soldier together with
the case.</p>

<p>The expectation not only of common soldiers, but
also of officials, led them to crane their necks to look
at the next comer. Even the ordinarily immobile
features of the chief relaxed into an expression of
anxiety as a young man walked down the aisle made
by the reverent receding of the crowd to either side.
He was not graceful in form. His body was beyond
the proportion of his legs; though his arms compensated
for any lack in the length of his lower limbs.
His neck was thick, the head round, with full development
of forehead, though that portion of his
face was somewhat concealed by the short, bushy
masses of red hair which protruded beneath his rimless
Janizary cap. His face was homely, but strongly
marked, evincing force of character as clearly as the
convolutions of his muscles evinced animal strength
and endurance. The brightness of his eye atoned for
any lack of beauty in his features; as did his free and
manly bearing make ample amends for deficiency in
grace of form. Altogether he was a man to attract
one's attention and hold it pleasantly.</p>

<p>Though he bent low to the earth in his obeisance
to the chief officer of his troop, it was without the suggestion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
of obsequiousness, with that dignity which betokens
real reverence and crowns itself with the honor
it would give to another.</p>

<p>The chief Aga announced that, although the witnesses
in this case were not of the order of the Yeni-Tscheri,
and, therefore, had no claim to the consideration
of the court, yet it pleased him in this peculiar case
to waive the right to try the matter exclusively among
themselves, that the good name of the Yeni-Tscheri
might suffer no reproach. "Caraza-Bey," added the
chief, "for some reason best known to himself does
not accept the privilege we have extended him, to
speak in our official presence what he has freely spoken
elsewhere. We shall, therefore, hear any witnesses he
may have sent."</p>

<p>One Lovitsch, belonging to the irregular auxiliary
troops, testified that Captain Ballaban had organized
a raid upon an Albanian village, and engaged himself
and company for the venture; but had left them in
the heat of the fight, not rejoining them until the second
day. A common soldier deposed that the captain
returned to the company early in the second evening,
and induced him, the witness, and Koremi, to whom
the captain had entrusted a beautiful captive, to bring
the girl to the rear, under plea of getting from her information
regarding the enemy; and had then mysteriously
disappeared with her. Koremi corroborated
this testimony.</p>

<p>Captain Ballaban gave a look of puzzled curiosity as
he heard this; but otherwise evinced not the slightest
emotion.</p>

<p>The crowd gazed upon the young captain with disappointment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
while testimony was being given. The
agas present being unable to conceal the deep anxiety
depicted upon their countenances, as they leaned
forward with impatience to hear from his lips some
exonerating statement, which, however, they feared
could not be given. A few faces wore a look of contemptuous
triumph. But two persons maintained composure.
It might be expected that the chief Aga,
from his familiarity with such scenes, if not from the
propriety of his being the formal embodiment of the
rigid and remorseless court of the Janizaries, whose
decrees he was to announce, would show no emotion,
however strong his sympathy with the prisoner.</p>

<p>The endangered man answered his gaze with equal
stolidity when the judge turned to him for his defence;
but he remained speechless. A shudder of
horror ran through the crowd. The executioner
stepped forward to the side of the apparently convicted
person. A slight ringing sound, as the long curve of
the well-tempered blade grazed the ground, sent to
every heart the chilling announcement of his readiness.
The chief Aga turned to the others, but sought in vain
any palliatory suggestion or appeal for mercy, except
in the mute agony of their looks. The chief then
raised his eyes as if for the invocation of Allah's confirmation
of the sentence as just. But his prayer was
a strange one:&mdash;"Oh, Allah! thou hast given a
wondrous spirit to this man; a courage worthy
of the soul of Othman himself!" Then rising with
excitement he addressed the throng in rapid
speech.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<p>"Look upon this man, my brothers of the shining
face!<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>"Did he quail at the ring of the executioner's sword?
Did he even change color when he heard the damning
testimony? A true son of Kara Khalif is he. A word
from his lips would have exonerated him, yet he
would not speak it lest it should reveal the secrets of
our service, which he would keep with dead lips rather
than live to tell them. But I shall be his witness; and
you, my brothers, shall be his judges. Captain Ballaban
was recalled from the raid by our brother Sinam,
aga of the division to which the captain belongs. But,
alas! the sword of Scanderbeg has loosed Sinam's
soul for flight to paradise, and he could not testify to
this man's fidelity. But I know the order of Sinam;
in this very tent it was written. And though the
faithful messenger who carried it was slain in after
conflict, the order was executed by Captain Ballaban
to every letter: every moment of his absence from the
raid is accounted for on my tablets"&mdash;tapping his forehead
as he spoke.</p>

<p>A loud shout burst from the crowd which made the
tent shake as if filled with a rising wind.</p>

<p>"Ballaban! Ballaban!" cried the multitude, lifting
the brave fellow upon their shoulders.</p>

<p>"Take that for your grin when you thought he was
guilty!" shouted one, as he delivered a tremendous
blow upon the face of another.</p>

<p>"Death to Caraza-Bey! Down with the lying villain!"
rose the cry, the crowd beginning to move,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
as if animated by a common spirit, to seek the
envious commandant of the neighboring corps. But
they halted at the tent side waiting for the sign of
permission from their chief, who, by the motion of
his hand forbade the assault which would have brought
on a terrific battle between the Janizaries and their
rivals throughout the army.</p>

<p>"We shall deal with Caraza-Bey hereafter, if his
shame does not send him skulking from the camps,"
said the chief, resuming his sitting posture, and
restoring order about him.</p>

<p>"Summon the witnesses again," he proceeded.</p>

<p>"You Lovitsch testified truly as to Captain Ballaban's
absence, and may go. But you twin rascals who swore
to his escape with the girl, your heads shall go to
Caraza-Bey, and your black souls to the seventh hell.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
Executioner, do your office!"</p>

<p>"Hold!" cried Ballaban, as the man drew his
cimeter. "Upon my return to the company I found
my fair captive gone, and under such strange circumstances
that I can see that these good fellows may be
honest in what they have stated. I bespeak thy
mercy, Sire, for them."</p>

<p>"Captain Ballaban's will shall be ours," replied the
chief, with a wave of his hand dismissing the assemblage.
As the crowd withdrew, he said, "My brothers,
the agas, will remain, and Captain Ballaban."</p>

<p>The sides of the tent were put up. The guard
patrolled without at a distance of sixty paces, that no
one might overhear the conversation in the council.</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">"H</span>as Captain Ballaban any explanation of this conspiracy
against him?" asked one.</p>

<p>"None!" was the laconic reply. But after a
moment's pause he added: "Perhaps there was no
conspiracy, except as our jealous neighbors are willing
to take advantage of every unseemly circumstance
that can be twisted to point against any of the Yeni-Tscheri.
This may explain something. The girl
that I captured at the Giaour village was no common
peasant, by the cheek of Ayesha! Her face, as lit by
the blazing konak, was of such beauty as I have never
seen except in some dreams of my childhood. Her
voice and manner in commanding me to liberate her
were those of one well-born or used to authority. It
was well that I bethought me to give her into the
keeping of that dull-headed Koremi, or she might
have bewitched me into obeying her and letting her
go. My belief is that the girl was rescued. It may
be that our men were heavily bribed to give her up,
or that some one personated myself and demanded
her, and that the story of my return may be thus
accounted for, but I cannot see any treachery in
Koremi's manner. If she was of any special value to
Scanderbeg he would find some way of running her
off, though he had to make a league with the devil
and assume my shape to do it. The Arnaouts, you
know, believe that the Vili are in collusion with Scanderbeg,
and that one of them, a he-vili, Radisha, or
some such sprite, is his body servant. That will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
account for it all," added he, laughing at the conceit.</p>

<p>"But," said the second Aga, "Caraza-Bey's insult
was none the less, if your surmise be true. We must
wash it out in the blood of a hundred or so of his
hirelings to-morrow."</p>

<p>The chief shook his head.</p>

<p>"But," continued the second Aga, "the jealousy of
our corps must be punished. You see how near it
came to losing for us the life of one of our bravest.
Caraza-Bey must fight me to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Bravo!" cried all; while one added, "And let
the challenge be public, that the entire force of the
Yeni-Tscheri be on hand and all the troops of the
Beyler Bey of Anatolia, and&mdash;" lowering his voice&mdash; "we
can manage it so that the fight become general,
and teach these reptiles of Asiatics that the Yeni-Tscheri
are the right hand and the brain of the
empire."</p>

<p>"Ay, <i>are</i> the empire!" said another. "Let us
have a scrimmage that will be interesting. The war
with Scanderbeg is getting monotonous. One day he
comes into our camp, like a butcher into a slaughter
pen, and the next day we are marched out to him, to
be slaughtered elsewhere. It requires one to be full
of Islam, the Holy Resignation, to stand this sort of
life. Yes! let's do a little fighting in our own way
and get rid of some of this soldier spawn which the
Padishah has brought with him from across the
Bosphorus!"</p>

<p>"But you forget, my brothers," said Ballaban,
"that this fight with the Sanjak Bey does not belong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
to any one beside myself. His lie was about me. I
then am the man to take off his head; and I think I
can do it with as good grace as the executioner was
nigh to taking off mine just now."</p>

<p>"No, Captain!" said the chief. "Your rank is as
yet below the Bey's, and he would make that an
excuse for declining the gage. Besides," said he,
lowering his voice, "I have special service for you
elsewhere, which cannot be delayed."</p>

<p>When the agas, making the low courtesy, retired, the
chief walked with Ballaban.</p>

<p>"Captain, I have heard no report of the errand upon
which you were sent."</p>

<p>"No, Sire, I was arrested the moment I returned to
camp."</p>

<p>"You succeeded, I know, from the movements of the
enemy: although the slowness of the Padishah in ordering
an advance, when Scanderbeg was diverted by your
ruse, prevented our taking advantage of it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ballaban, "I succeeded as well as any
one could, not being seconded from headquarters.
But I did some service incidentally, and picked up
some helpful information. The night after leaving the
hamlet we fired, I fell in with a company of Arnaouts
who were coming to the rescue. They would have got
into the narrow valley before our men got out, had I not
managed to trick them. I was in disguise and readily
passed for an Arnaout lout, giving them false information
about the direction our party had taken, and so
lost them an hour or two, and saved the throats of
Lovitsch's fellows, a mere rabble, good enough for a
raid, but not to be depended upon for a square fight.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
But we must have no more raids. Scanderbeg has
means of communication as quick and subtle as if
the clouds were his signals and the stars were his
beacons.</p>

<p>"I then came upon a Dibrian settlement, pretending
to be a fugitive from the valleys to the north;
and entertained the villagers with bug-a-boo stories
about the hosts of men with turbans on their heads
and little devils on their shoulders who had destroyed
all that country, and were now pouring down toward
the south.</p>

<p>"By the way," continued Ballaban laughing, "there
was an old fellow there, very lame, with a patch over
one eye, who could hardly stand leaning on his staff,
he was so palsied with age. But the one eye that was
open was altogether too bright for his years; and his
legs didn't shake enough for one who rattled his staff
so much. So I put him down as one of Scanderbeg's
lynxes&mdash;they are everywhere. I described to him the
Moslem movements in such a way as to let a trained
soldier believe that we had entirely changed front,
with the prospective raising of the siege of Sfetigrade
and alliance with the Venetians for carrying the
war farther to the north. The old codger took the
bait, and asked fifty questions in the tone of a fellow
whose head had been used for a mush-pot instead of
a brain-holder; but every question was in its meaning
as keen as a dagger-thrust into the very ribs of the
military situation. Well! I helped him to all the
information he wanted; when with a twinkle in his
eye, he hobbled away, as wise as an owl when a fresh
streak of day-light has struck him: and before night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
the whole country to the borders of Sternogovia was
alive with Scanderbeg's scouts; and every cross-path
was a rendezvous of his broken-winded cavalry.</p>

<p>"I saw one thing which gave me a hint I may use
some day. At a village the women were carrying
water from a spring far down in a ravine, though
there was a fine flowing fountain quite near them. It
seems that a dog had got into the fountain about a
month before, and was drowned. These Dibrians
believe that, if any one should drink the water of
such a spring before as many days have passed as
the dog has hairs on his tail, the water will make his
bowels rot, and his soul go into a dog's body when
he dies.</p>

<p>"The next night I spent inside the walls of Sfetigrade."</p>

<p>"No!" cried the chief. "Why, man, you must fly
the air with the witches!"</p>

<p>"Not at all, I have some acquaintances in that snug
little place; and when they go to bed they hang the
key of the town on a moonbeam for me. If it is not
there, I have only to vault over the walls, or sail over
them on the clouds, or burrow under them with the
moles, or hold my breath until I turn into a sprite,
like the wizards on the Ganges, and lo! I am in.
Well! that night I lodged with a worthy family of Sfetigrade,
pretending that I was a poor fugitive from the
very town we had raided a few nights before. And,
by the hair of the beautiful Malkhatoon!<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> I saw
there the very captive I had taken. She lay asleep on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
a cot just within a doorway&mdash;unless I was asleep
myself and dreaming, as I half believe I was."</p>

<p>"Yes, it was a dream of yours, no doubt, Captain,"
said the chief, "for when a young fellow like you once
gets a fair woman in his arms, as you say you had her
in yours the night of the raid, she never gets out of
the embrace of his imagination. He will see her everywhere,
and go about trying to hug her shadow.
Beware illusions, Captain! They use up a fellow's
thoughts, make him too meek-eyed to see things as a
soldier should. The love passion will take the energy
out of the best of us, as quickly as the fire takes the
temper out of the best Damascene blade."</p>

<p>"I thank you for your counsel, Aga," replied Ballaban,
his face coloring as deep as his hair. "But there
was one thing I saw with a waking eye."</p>

<p>"And what was that?"</p>

<p>"That there was but one well of water in the town
of Sfetigrade; the one in the citadel court. But another
thing I didn't see, though I searched the place for it;&mdash;and
that was a dog to throw into the well; or I
would have thirsted the superstitious garrison out.
They have eaten up the last cur."</p>

<p>"Then the surrender must come soon," said the
Aga.</p>

<p>"No," replied Ballaban, "for the voivode Moses
Goleme came into the town as I was leaving, driving
a flock of sheep which he had stolen from us; for he
had cut off an entire train of provisions which had
been sent to our camp from Adrianople."</p>

<p>"Then I must have you off at once on another errand,
Captain. You see yonder line of mountains off to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
northwest. It may be necessary to shift the war to
that region for a while. Ivan Beg,<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> the brother-in-law
of Scanderbeg, has raised a pack of wild fiends
among those hills of his, and is driving out all our
friends. Nothing can stand against him unless it be
the breasts of the Yeni-Tscheri. Scanderbeg may
compel us to raise the siege of Sfetigrade, for he
bleeds us daily like a leech. A diversion after Ivan
Beg will at least be more honorable than a return to
Adrianople. Now I would know exactly the passes
and best places for fortification in Ivan's country;
and you, Captain, are the man to find them out. You
should be off at once. Take your time and spy
thoroughly, making a map and transmitting to me
your notes. And while there feel the people. It is
rumored that the young voivode, Amesa, is restless
under the leadership of Scanderbeg. If a dissension
could be created among these Arnaouts, it would be
well. Amesa has a large personal following in that
north country; for his castle is just on the border
of it."</p>

<p>"But," replied Ballaban, "I must first pluck the
beard of that cowardly Caraza-Bey!"</p>

<p>"No! I forbid it. Your blood is worth more in
your own veins than anywhere else. I should not
consent to your risking a drop of it in personal combat
with any one except Scanderbeg himself."</p>

<p>The fight between the second Aga and Caraza-Bey
did not take place. That worthy was conveniently sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
by Sultan Amurath, who had learned of the feud, to
look after certain turbulent Caramanians; and leaving
behind him a wake of curses upon all Janizaries from
the chief to the pot-scourers, he took his departure for
the Asiatic provinces.</p>

<p>Had he remained, the Turks would have had enough
to occupy them without this gratuitous mêlée. For
during the night scouts brought word that Scanderbeg
had massed all his forces, that were not behind the
walls of Sfetigrade, at a point to the right of the
Turkish lines. Hardly had the army been faced to
meet this attack, when scouts came from the left,
reporting serious depredations on that flank.
Amurath, in the uncertainty of the enemy's movement,
divided his host. The Asiatics were given the northern
and the Janizaries the southern defence; either
of them outnumbering any force Scanderbeg could
send against them. But, as a tornado cuts its broad
swath through a forest, uprooting or snapping the
gigantic trees, showing its direction only by the after
track of desolation, which it cuts in almost unvarying
width, while beyond its well defined lines scarcely a
branch is broken or a nest overturned among the
swaying foliage&mdash;so Scanderbeg swooped from east
to west through the very centre of the Turkish encampment,
gathering up arms and provisions, and strewing
his track with the bodies of the slain. By the time
that the Moslems were sufficiently concentrated to offer
effective resistance the assailants were gone.</p>

<p>At the head of the victorious band Scanderbeg rode
a small and ungainly, but tough and tireless animal&mdash;like
most of the Albanian horses, which were better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
adapted to threading their way down the pathless
mountain sides, than to curveting in military parade&mdash;their
lack of natural ballast being made up by the
enormous burdens they were trained to carry.</p>

<p>The figure and bearing of Scanderbeg, however,
amply compensated the lack of martial picturesqueness
in his steed. He was in full armor, except that
his sword arm was bared. His beard of commingled
yellow and gray fell far down upon the steel plates of
his corselet. A helmet stuck far back upon his head,
showed the massive brow which seemed of ampler
height, from the Albanian custom of clipping short, or
shaving the hair off from the upper forehead.</p>

<p>Wheeling his horse, he engaged in conversation with
a stout, but awkward soldier.</p>

<p>"You and your beast are well matched, Constantine.
You both need better training before you are fit to
parade as prisoners of Amurath. You sit your horse
as a cat rides a dog, though you do hold on as well
with your heel as she with her claws. Your short legs
would do better to clamp the belly of a crocodile."</p>

<p>"Yes, we are both accustomed to marching and
fighting in our own way, rather than in company,"
replied Constantine. "But the beast has not failed
me by a false step; not when we leaped the fallen oak
and landed in the gulch back yonder. The beast
came down as safely and softly as on the training
lawn."</p>

<p>"And you have done as well yourself," replied the
general. "That was a bad play though you had with
the Turk as we cut our way through the last knot of
them. But for a side thrust which I had time to give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
at your antagonist, while waiting for the slow motions
of my own, I fear that your animal would be lighter
now by just your weight. You strike powerfully, but
you do not recover yourself skilfully. A good swordsman
would get a response into your ribs before you could
deal him a second. Here, I will show you! Now
thrust! Strike! No, not so; but hard, villainously, at
me, as if I were the Turk who stole your girl! So!
Again! Again!&mdash;Now learn this movement"&mdash;pressing
his own sword steadily against his companion's, and
bending him back until he was almost off his horse.
"And this," dealing so tremendous a slash with the
back of the sword that Constantine's arm was almost
numbed by the effort to resist it.&mdash;"And this!" transmitting
a twisting motion from his own to his opponent's
weapon, so that for one instant they seemed like
two serpents writhing together; but at the next
Constantine's sword was twirled out his hand.</p>

<p>"You will make a capital swordsman with practice,
my boy. And the girl? Keep a sharpened eye for
her; and tell me if so much as a new spider's web be
woven at her door."</p>

<p>A peasant woman stood by the path as they proceeded,
holding out her hand for alms, as she ran
beside the general's horse. He leaned toward her to
give something; but, as his hand touched hers, she
slipped a bit of white rag into it:</p>

<p>"The map of the roads, Sire, twixt this and
Monastir!"</p>

<p>"And your son, my good woman?" inquired the
general kindly.</p>

<p>"Ah! the Virgin pity me, Sire, for he died. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
could not stop the bleeding, for the lance's point had
cut a vein. But I have a daughter who can take his
place. She knows the signals&mdash;for he taught them to
her&mdash;and can make the beacon as well as he; and is as
nimble of foot to climb the crag. But please, Sire, the
child did not remember if the enemy going west was
to be signalled by lighting the beacon before or after
the bright star's setting."</p>

<p>"Just after, good mother. If they go to the east
and cross the mountain, fire the beacon just before the
star sets. And the brightest of all stars be for your
own hope and comfort!"</p>

<p>"And for dear Albania's and thine own!" replied
the woman, disappearing in the crowd, as a man
dashed close to Scanderbeg on a well-jaded steed.</p>

<p>"The Turkish auxiliaries will be at the entrance to
the defile in thirty hours."</p>

<p>"Your estimate of their number, neighbor Stephen?"</p>

<p>"From three to five thousand."</p>

<p>"Not more?"</p>

<p>"Not more in the first detachment. A second of
equal size follows, but a day in the rear."</p>

<p>"Good! Take with you our nephew, Musache de
Angeline, and five hundred Epirots each. This will
be sufficient to prevent the first detachment getting
out of the pass. I will strike the second from the rear
as soon as they enter the pass. They can not
man&oelig;uvre in that crooked and narrow defile, and we
will destroy them at our leisure. Strike promptly.
Farewell!"</p>

<p>"Miserable sheep!" he muttered, "why will these
Turks so tempt me to slaughter them?"

<h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">U</span>pon the southern slope of the Black Mountain&mdash;that
is, on the rising uplands which lead from
Albania to Montenegro&mdash;lay the ancient and princely
estates of the De Streeses. A dense forest of pines
spread for miles, like a myriad gigantic pillars in some
vast temple. They seemed to support, as it were,
some Titanic dome surrounded with pinnacles and
turrets, a huge cluster of jagged rocks, which was
called by those who gazed upon it from leagues away
"The Eyrie." In the midst of these great monoliths,
and hardly distinguishable from them, rose the walls
of the new castle which the voivode Amesa had built
upon the ruins of that destroyed at the time of the
massacre of its former possessor.</p>

<p>The horse of the voivode stood within the court, his
head drooping, and the white sweat-foam drying upon
his heated flanks. His master paced up and down the
enclosure, engaged in low but excited conversation
with a soldier.</p>

<p>The voivode was of princely mien; tall, but compactly
built; face full in its lower development, and
somewhat sensual; eyes gray and restless, which gave
one at first a sharp, penetrating glance, and then
seemed to hide behind the half-closed lids, like some
wild animal that inspects the hunter hastily, then takes
to covert.</p>

<p>"You are sure, Drakul, that the party which drove
you from the hamlet were Turks, and not Arnaouts in
disguise, like yourselves?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<p>"I could not mistake," said Drakul, a hard-faced
man, one of whose eyebrows was arched higher than
the other, and whose entire countenance was distorted
from the symmetrical balance of its two sides, giving
an expression of duplicity and cruelty. "I could not
mistake, noble Amesa, for I have too often eyed those
rascals over the point of my sword not to know a Turk
in the dark. But all the fiends combined against us
that night. We left our two best men dead, and the
two we wanted, the boy and the girl, escaped us. The
she-witch did not come back to the village the next day;
but the red-headed imp did, and raved like a hyena
when he found the girl missing. I watched him as he
suddenly went off, doubtless, to some spot they both
knew of. The young thief stole the clothes off a dead
Turk. The next day we spied him again; this time
with that Arnaud-Kabilovitsch, Albanian-Servian,
forester-colonel, or whatever he may be, who came
back when Castriot did. The fellow escaped us a
second time."</p>

<p>"Track him! track him!" cried Amesa spitefully.
"I will make you rich, Drakul, the day you bring me
that fox's brush of red hair from his head."</p>

<p>"I have tracked him and could take you to the very
spot where he and the girl are to-day," said the man.
"Come this way, my noble Amesa,"&mdash;leading him to
the side of the court commanding a far stretch of
country to the north-west. "Now let your eye follow
Skadar<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> along the left shore: then up the great river.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
Not two leagues from the mountain spur that bends
the stream out of your sight, at the hamlet just off the
road into your Uncle Ivan's country&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The stargeshina has a red goitre like a turkey
cock? I know every hut in the hamlet," interrupted
Amesa. "But why think you she is there?"</p>

<p>"Why? I have seen her, and him with her. I followed
the fellow day after day. Once I saw him yonder
on the spur. He clipped the bark of a tree, and
in the smoothed spot cut a line. A little beyond he
did the same thing again. He spied this way and that
way with all the pains one would take to pick a way
for an army. Then he took a roll of paper from his
bosom, and marked down something for every mark
he had made upon the trees. And when he was out
of sight I took the range of his marks, and by St.
Theckla! they pointed straight to a path which led
down the mountain to the ford in the great river that
is opposite the old turkey cock's konak."</p>

<p>"But you may have mistaken the man," suggested
Amesa.</p>

<p>"Not I, Sire. I know his head as well as a bull
knows a red rag; and his duck legs, and his walk like
an ambling horse."</p>

<p>"It is he," submitted Amesa. "But how know you
that the girl was there in the hamlet?"</p>

<p>"Did I not see her, my noble Amesa? And could
I not know her from the look of her father? If I
could forget him living, I have never passed a night
without seeing his face as it was dead, when we
dragged him to the burning beams of the old house
that stood on this&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span></p>

<p>"Silence!" cried Amesa in a sudden burst of rage.
"How dare you allude to my uncle's death without my
bidding?"</p>

<p>There was a pause for a few moments, during which
Amesa stamped heavily upon the stone pavement of
the court as he walked, like one endeavoring to shake
off from his person some noisome thing that troubled
him. The man resumed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Besides, the children of the village said she was a
stray kid there, and not of kin to anybody. And while
I was there the same stump-headed fellow who marked
the direction came to the hamlet."</p>

<p>"Be ready to accompany me to-morrow, Drakul.
You can say that we are scouting."</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he lake of Skadar lay like an immense <i>lapis lazuli</i>
within its setting of mountains, which, on the east,
were golden with the rays of the declining sun, and on
the west, enameled in emerald with the dense shadows
their summits dropped upon them. The surface
of the water was unbroken, save here and there by
black spots where a pair of loons shrieked their
marital unhappiness, or a flock of wild ducks floated,
like a miniature fleet, about the reed-fringed shores of
some little island. Had there been watchers on the
fortress of Obod, which lay on the cliff just above
where the Tsernoyevitcha enters Skadar, they would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
have espied a light shallop gliding along the eastern
bank of the lake. This contained the voivode Amesa
and his attendant. Just at night-fall they reached the
cavern, whose hidden recesses begot a hundred legends
which the weird shadows of the cave clothed in forms
as fantastic as their own, and which still flit among
the hamlets of Montenegro. It was said that whoever
should sleep within the cave would rest his head on
the bosoms of the nymphs:&mdash;only let him take care
that their love does not prevent his ever waking.
Amesa and his companion were courageous, but discretion
led them to wind the strooka about their heads,
and seek without a couch of pine needles between the
enormous roots of the trees which had dropped them.</p>

<p>The dawn had just silvered the east, and the coming
sun transformed the cold blue tints of Skadar into
amber, when they entered the river. The great stream
wound through the broad lowlands of Tsetinie, girdled
with rocky hills. Then it dashed in impetuous
floods between more straightened banks, or lingered,
as if the river spirit would bathe himself in the deep
pools that were cooled by the springs at their bottoms.
Though familiar with the phenomenon, they
loitered that they might watch the schools of fish
which were so dense in places as to impede the stroke
of the oar blade, and tint the entire stream with their
dull silvery gleam.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Emerging from a tortuous channel,
through which the river twisted itself like a vast
shining serpent, they came to a cluster of houses that
nestled in a gorge. These houses were made of stone,
and so covered with vines as to be hardly distinguishable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
from the dense shrubbery that clambered over
the rocks about them.</p>

<p>Amesa was warmly greeted by the stargeshina who
occupied the konak, or principal house. The older
people remembered the visitor as the comely lad who,
before the return of George Castriot, was almost the
only male representative of that noble family left in
the land. The voivode was honored with every evidence
that the villagers felt themselves complimented
by the visit of their guest, whatever business or caprice
might have brought him thither.</p>

<p>A simple repast was provided, in which the courtesy
of the service on the part of the stargeshina more
than compensated any poverty in the display of viands;&mdash;though
there were set forth meats dried in strips in
the smoke of an open fire; eggs; sweet, though
black bread; and wine pressed from various mountain
berries, and allowed to ferment in skins. As they
sat beside a low table at the doorway of the konak,
the stargeshina offered a formal salâm, the zdravitsa,
which was half a toast and half a prayer, and extended
his hand to Amesa in the protestation of personal
friendship. At the meal the glories of Castriot and
Ivan Beg&mdash;or Ivo, as the peasants called him&mdash;were
duly recited.</p>

<p>"But why," said the old man, rising to his feet with the
enthusiasm of the sentiment&mdash;"Why should the country
sing the praises of George Castriot, who for thirty
years was willing to be a Turk and fight for an alien
faith? Your shoulders, noble Amesa&mdash;Prince Amesa,
my loyal heart would call you&mdash;could as well have
borne the burden of the people's defence. Your arm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
could strike as good a blow as his for Albania. Your
blood is that of the Castriots, and untainted by Moslem
touch. Your estates, since you have become heir
to the lands of De Streeses, make you our richest and
most influential voivode."</p>

<p>These words made the eyes of Amesa flash, not
with any novel pleasure, rather with an ambition to
which he was no stranger. But the flash was smothered
at once by the half-closed eyelids, and he responded&mdash;</p>

<p>"I ought not to hear such words, my good friend.
My Uncle George is the hero of the hour. The people
need a hero in whom they believe; and the very
mystery of his life for the thirty years among the
Turks, and the romance of his return, make him a convenient
hero."</p>

<p>"But Sire, my noble&mdash;my Prince Amesa&mdash;do you
not daily hear such words as I speak? The thought
is as common as the Pater Noster, and echoes from
Skadar to Ochrida. It was but a week since a young
Albanian passed through this border country, whispering
everywhere that the land was ready to cry
Amesa's name rather than the reformed renegade,
George Castriot's; that Scanderbeg, the Lord Alexander,
the strutting title the Turks gave him, was an
offence to the free hearts of the people."</p>

<p>"Ah! and what sort of a man for look was this
Albanian?" asked Amesa in surprise.</p>

<p>"A sturdy youth of, say, twenty summers, with hair
like a turban which had been worn by a dozen slaughtered
Turks, so blood red is it."</p>

<p>Amesa gave a puzzled look toward Drakul, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
was eating his meal at a little distance, but whose
ears seemed to prick up like those of a horse at this
description.</p>

<p>"It is likely that he may be again in the village this
very night. Our neighbor next lodged him. I will
ask him if he will return," said the stargeshina, leaving
the konak for a little.</p>

<p>"It is he; it's that Constantine," said Drakul,
coming nearer to Amesa. "The wily young devil is
ready to betray your Uncle George. That will make
the matter easier."</p>

<p>"The way is clear, then," replied Amesa. "I am
glad that the raid was not successful. It might have
led to further blood. With this fellow in league with
us, it is straight work and honorable."</p>

<p>The stargeshina reported the man would probably
be in again that very night, and added:</p>

<p>"I would you could see him; for though he is fair
spoken, there is some mystery in his going day after
day among these mountains, like a hound who is looking
for a lost scent."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is attracted here by some of the fair
maidens of the hamlets," suggested Amesa, looking at
Drakul, who was tearing a bit of jerked meat in his
teeth, apparently intent only upon that selfish occupation.</p>

<p>"It may well be, for our neighbor here has harbored
a bit of stray womanhood which might tempt a monk
to lodge there rather than in his cell," said the old
man.</p>

<p>A shout from above them attracted their attention
to a merry company which was coming down the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
mountain. It was the procession of the Dodola.
Drought threatened to destroy the scanty grain growing
in the narrow valleys, and the vines on the terraces
cut out of the steep hills. According to an ancient
custom, a young maiden had been taken by her companions
into the woods, stripped of her usual garments,
and reclothed in the leaves and flowers of the endangered
vegetation. Long grasses and stalks of grain
were matted in many folds about her person, and
served as a base for artistic decoration with every
variety of floral beauty. Her feet were buskined in
clover blossoms. A kilt of broad-leaved ferns hung
from her waist, which was belted with a broad zone of
wild roses. White and pink laurel blossoms made
her bodice. An ivy wreath upon her brows was starred
with white daisies, and plumed with the stems and
hanging bells of the columbine.</p>

<p>The Dodola thus appeared as the impersonation of
floral nature athirst for the vivifying rains. Her
attendants, who led her in a leash of roses, chanted a
hymn, the refrain of which was a prayer to Elijah,
who, since he brought the rain at Carmel, is supposed
by the peasants of Albania to be that saint to whom
Providence has committed the shepherding of the
clouds. As the procession wound down the terraced
paths between the houses, the Dodola was welcomed
by the matrons of the hamlet, who stood each in her
own doorway, with hair gathered beneath a cap of
coins, teeth enameled in black, fingers tipped brownish-red
with henna. The maidens sung a verse of their
hymn at each cottage; and, at the refrain, the housewife
poured upon the head of the leaf-clad Dodola a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
cup of water; repeating the last line of the chorus,
"Good Saint Elias, so send the rain!"</p>

<p>As the Dodola paused before the konak, Amesa
said, quite enthusiastically, and designing to be overheard
by the fair girl who took the part of thirsting
nature, "If Elias can refuse the prayer of so much
womanly beauty, I swear, by Jezebel, that I shall hereafter
believe, with the Turks, that the austere old
prophet has become bewitched with the houris in
paradise, and so does not care to look into the faces of
earthly damsels."</p>

<p>"You may still keep your Christian faith, for the Dodola
has won the favor of the Thunderer,"<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> replied the
stargeshina. "Listen to his love-making in response
to the witchery of that wild dove! Do you hear it?"</p>

<p>The distant murmur of a coming shower confirmed
the credulity of the peasants.</p>

<p>"Yes, soon the Holy Virgin will turn her bright
glances upon us,"<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> said he looking at the sky.</p>

<p>"Who is that wild dove who acts the Dodola?"
inquired Amesa.</p>

<p>"The one I told you of, who has come into our
neighbor's cot," replied the old man. "But only the
sharp eyes of the crows saw where she came from.
Did she not speak our tongue and know our ways as
well as any of us, I should say she was one of the
Tsigani who were driven out of the morning land by
Timour.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Yet it may be that her own story is true.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
She says she had two lovers in her village; and these
two were brothers in God, who had taken the vow
before heaven and St. John to help and never to hinder
each other in whatever adventure of love or brigandage,
at cost of limb or life. But as the hot blood
of neither of these lovers could endure to see this
nymph in the arms of the other, it was determined that
she should be slain by the hand of both, rather than
that the sacred brotherhood should be broken. By
her own father's hearth the two daggers were struck
together at her heart. But the strong arms of the
slayers collided, and both blows glanced. She escaped
and fled, and came hither."</p>

<p>"And you believe this story?" asked Amesa, with
a look of incredulity mingled with triumph, as of one
who knew more than the narrator.</p>

<p>"I believe her story, noble Amesa, because&mdash;because
no one has told me any other. But&mdash;" He shook
his head.</p>

<p>"Does not the young stranger you spoke of know
something of her, that he prowls about this neighborhood?"
asked the guest.</p>

<p>"It may be. I had not thought it, but it may well
be! Hist&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The Dodola passed by, returning to her own cottage.
As she did so her bright black eyes glanced
coquettishly at the stranger from beneath her disarranged
chaplet of flowers and dishevelled hair. She
soon returned, having assumed her garments as a
peasant maid, but with evident effort to make this
simple attire set off the great natural beauty of face
and form, of which she was fully conscious. Her forehead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
was too low; but Pygmalion could not have
chiselled a brow and temples upon which glossy black
ringlets clustered more bewitchingly. Her eyes flashed
too cold a fire light to give one the impression of great
amiability in their possessor; but the long lashes
which drooped before them, partially veiled their stare
so as to give the illusion of coyness, if not of maidenly
modesty. Her mouth was perhaps sensuously
curved; but was one of those marvellously plastic ones
which can tell by the slightest arching or compressing of
the lips as much of purpose or feeling as most people can
tell in words:&mdash;dangerous lips to the possessor, if she
be guileless and unsuspicious, for they reveal too much
of her soul to others who have no right to know its
secrets; dangerous lips to others if she would deceive,
for they can lie, consummately, wickedly, without uttering
a word. Her complexion was scarcely brunette;
rather that indescribable fairness in which the whiteness
of alabaster is tinged with the blood of perfect health,
slightly bronzed by constant exposure to the sunshine
and air&mdash;a complexion seldom seen except in Syria,
the Greek Islands, or Wales. Her form was faultless,&mdash;just
at that stage of development when the grace
and litheness of childhood are beginning to be lost in
the statelier mysteries of womanly beauty; that transition
state between two ideals of loveliness, which, from
the days of Phidias, has lured, but always eluded, the
artist's skill to reproduce.</p>

<p>The girl's face flushed with the consciousness of
being gazed at approvingly by the courtly stranger.
But the pretty toss of her head showed that the blush
was due as much to the conceit of her beauty as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
bashfulness. As she talked with the other maidens,
she glanced furtively toward the door of the konak,
where Amesa sat. The young voivode foresaw that it
would not be difficult to entice the girl herself to be
the chief agent in any plan he might have for her abduction.</p>

<p>He needed, however, to make more certain of her
identity with the object of his search. He could discern
no trace of Mara De Streeses in her face; much
less in her manner. Since Drakul had suggested it,
he imagined a resemblance to De Streeses himself,
whose bearing was haughty and his temperament fiery.</p>

<p>The evening brought the young man of whom the
stargeshina had spoken. His resemblance to the
description given him of Constantine left no doubt in
Amesa's mind of his being the mysterious custodian
of the heiress to his estates. The young Servian he
supposed would at once recognize him as Amesa; for,
as a prominent officer in the army, his face would be
well known to all who had been in Castriot's camps,
even if the gossip of the villagers did not at once
inform him of his presence. It were best then, thought
Amesa, to boldly confront him; win him, if possible,
to his service; if not, destroy him.</p>

<p>The young stranger was at once on frolicksome
terms with the village girls and lads; and Amesa
thought he observed that through it all the fellow kept
a sharp, if not a suspicious, eye upon him. Lest he
should escape, the voivode invited him to walk beyond
the houses of the village. When out of sight and
hearing he suddenly turned upon the young man, and,
laying a hand upon his shoulder, exclaimed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>"You are known, man!"</p>

<p>Upon the instant the stranger was transformed
from the sauntering peasant into a gladiator, with feet
firmly planted, the left hand raised as a shield, and the
right grasping a yataghan which had been concealed
upon his person. Amesa, though the aggressor, was
thrown upon the defensive, and was compelled to retreat
in order to gain time for the grip of his weapon.</p>

<p>The two men stood glaring into each other's eyes
as there each to read his antagonist's movement before
his hand began to execute it.</p>

<p>"I did not know that a Servian peasant was so
trained," said Amesa, still retreating before the advance
of his opponent, who gave him no opportunity
to assume the offensive.</p>

<p>"For whom do you take me that you dare to lay a
rough hand on me?" said the man, half in menace,
and yet apparently willing to discover if his assailant
were right in his surmise.</p>

<p>"Arnaud's man and I need not be enemies," said
Amesa, seeing no chance of relieving himself from the
advantage the other had gained in the sword play. "I
can reward you better than he or Castriot."</p>

<p>A smile passed over the man's face, which Amesa
might have detected the meaning of had his mind
been less occupied with thoughts about his personal
safety from the yataghan, whose point was seeking his
throat according to the most approved rules of single
combat.</p>

<p>"And what if I am Arnaud's man?"</p>

<p>As he said this the yataghan made a thorough reconnoissance
of all the vulnerable parts of Amesa's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
body from the fifth rib upwards, followed by Amesa's
dagger in ward.</p>

<p>"You do not deny it?" said the Albanian between
breaths.</p>

<p>"I deny nothing. Nor need I confess anything,
since you say I am known."</p>

<p>"Shall we be friends?" asked Amesa, cautiously
lowering his arm.</p>

<p>"You made war, and can withdraw its declaration,
or take the consequences," was the reply.</p>

<p>The two men put up their weapons.</p>

<p>"So good a soldier as you are should not be here
guarding a girl," said Amesa.</p>

<p>"Guarding a girl?" said the man in amazement,
but, recollecting himself, added, "And why not guard
a girl?"</p>

<p>"Come," replied Amesa, "you and I can serve each
other. You can do that for me which no other man
can; and I can give to you more gold than any other
Albanian can."</p>

<p>"And when you are king of Albania, Prince Amesa,
you can reward me with high appointment," said the
stranger with a slight sneer, which, however, Amesa
did not notice, at the moment thinking of what the
stargeshina had said of the man's interest in the movement
against his uncle's leadership.</p>

<p>"You have but to ask your reward when that event
comes," he replied.</p>

<p>"I will swear to serve Amesa against Scanderbeg
to the death," said the man offering his hand.</p>

<p>"You know the girl's true story?" asked Amesa.</p>

<p>"Of course," was the cautious reply. "But of that I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
may not speak a word. I can leave his service whose
man you say I am, but I cannot betray anything he
may have told me. As you know the girl's story it is
needless to tempt me to divulge it," added he, with
shrewd non-committal of himself to any information
that the other might recognize as erroneous.</p>

<p>"You speak nobly for a Servian," said the voivode.</p>

<p>"How do you know I am a Servian?" asked the
stranger.</p>

<p>"Partly from your accent. You have not got our
pure Albanian tongue, though it is now six years you
have been talking it. And then Arnaud&mdash;Colonel
Kabilovitsch&mdash;came back as a Servian. Is it not so?"
asked Amesa, noticing the surprised look which the
mention of Kabilovitsch's name brought to the man's
face.</p>

<p>For a while the stranger was lost in thought; but
with an effort throwing off a sort of reverie, he said:</p>

<p>"Pardon my silence. I have been thinking of your
proposal. May I follow you to the village after a little?
I would think over how best I can meet your proposition,
my Prince Amesa."</p>

<p>"I will await you at the konak. But first let us
swear friendship!" said the voivode.</p>

<p>"Heartily!" was the response. "With Amesa as
against Scanderbeg."</p>

<p>"You will induce the girl to go with me to my castle.
She will fare better there than here, playing Dodola to
these ignorant peasants."</p>

<p>"It is agreed."</p>

<p>As Amesa disappeared, the man sat down upon a
huge root of a tree, which for lack of earth had twined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
itself over the rock. He buried his face in his
hands&mdash;</p>

<p>"Strange! strange! is all this. Kabilovitsch? the
girl? Not my little playmate on the Balkans&mdash;sweet
faced Morsinia. The Dodola here is not she. If
Uncle Kabilovitsch is Colonel Kabilovitsch, or this
Arnaud he speaks of, then this treacherous Amesa is
on the wrong track. Can it be that Constantine&mdash;dear
little Constantine&mdash;is in Albania, and that I am mistaken
for him? No, this is impossible. But still I
must be wary, and not do that which would harm a
golden hair of Morsinia's head, if she be living, or
Constantine's, or Uncle Kabilovitsch's. There's some
mystery here. Only one thing is certain&mdash;Amesa
mistakes this pretty impudent Dodola girl for somebody
else. To get her off with him may serve that
somebody else: for the voivode is a villain: that
much is sure. The cursed Giaour serpent! I will
help him to get this saucy belle of the hamlet, and so
save somebody else, whoever she may be who is the
game for which he lays his snares."</p>

<p>An hour later the Dodola, whose name was Elissa,
passed Amesa and blushed deeply.</p>

<p>The family at whose house the girl was living made
no objection to Amesa's request that she should be
transferred to the protection of the voivode. The
elders of the village acquiesced; for, said one,</p>

<p>"We do not know who she is, and may get into
difficulty through harboring her."</p>

<p>Another averred his belief that she was possessed of
the evil eye; for he had observed her staring at the
olive tree the day before it was struck by lightning;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
and he declared that half the young men of the hamlet
were bewitched with her.</p>

<p>A sharp-tongued dame remarked that some of the
older men would rather listen to the merry tattle of
the sprite than to the most serious and wholesome
counsel of their own wives.</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">"D</span>o you know the mind of Gauton who commands
at the citadel in Sfetigrade?" asked Amesa of
his new confederate, as they parted.</p>

<p>"I have talked with him," replied the man. "He is
very cautious."</p>

<p>"Discover his opinion on the matter of my advancement,"
said Amesa.</p>

<p>"Send him some gift," suggested the man, "I will
take it to him. He is very fond of dogs, and I learn
that he has just lost a valuable mastiff. Could you
replace it from your kennels at the castle?"</p>

<p>"No, but I have a greyhound, of straight breed
since his ancestors came out of the ark. His jaws
are as slender as a heron's beak: chest deep as a
lion's: belly thin as a weasel's: a double span of my
arms from tip to tail. To-morrow night meet me at
the castle. Should I not have arrived, this will give
you admission," presenting him with a small knife, on
the bone handle of which was a rude carving of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
crest of Amesa. "Give it to the warden. He will
recognize it."</p>

<p>Long before the arrival of Amesa and Drakul at the
castle in company with Elissa, the stranger, whom the
reader will recognize as Captain Ballaban dressed as
an Albanian peasant, had been admitted. He had
wandered about the court, mounted the parapet,
inspected the draw-bridge and portcullis, clambered
down and up again the almost precipitous scarp of the
rock, and asked a hundred questions of the servants
regarding the paths by which the castle was approached.
The old warden entertained him with stories of
Amesa's early life, his acquisition of the estate, and
his prowess in battle; in all of which, while the
warden intended only the praise of his master, he discovered
to the attentive listener all the weaknesses of
the voivode's character.</p>

<p>Upon Amesa's arrival late in the day, Ballaban
avoided much intercourse with him, except in relation
to the selection of the dog. To Elissa he gave a few
words of advice, to the effect that she was now the
object of the young lord's adoration; and that, in
order to secure her advantage, she should make as
much as possible a mystery of her previous life.
With this council&mdash;which was as much as he dared to
venture upon in his own ignorance of the exact part he
was playing&mdash;Ballaban departed, leading a magnificent
hound in leash. A little way from the castle he
sat down, and drawing from his breast a roll of paper,
added certain lines and comments, as he muttered to
himself,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have made neater drawings than this for old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Bestorf in the school of the Yeni-Tscheri, but none that
will please the Aga more. There is not a goat path
on the borders that I have not got. A sudden movement
of our armies, occupying ground here and here
and here, where I have blazed the trees, would hold
this country against Ivan Beg and Scanderbeg. And
with this black-hearted traitor, Amesa, in my fingers!&mdash;Well!
Let's see! I will force him into open
rebellion against Scanderbeg, unless he is deeper
witted than he seems. But which plan would be best
in the long run?&mdash;to stir up a feud between him and
Scanderbeg, and let them cut each other's throats?
Or, inveigle him to open alliance with our side, under
promise of being made king of Albania? That last
would settle all the Moslem trouble with these Giaours.
And it could be done. The Padishah offered Scanderbeg
the country on condition of paying a nominal
tribute, and would offer the same to Amesa. And
Amesa would take it, though he had to become Moslem.
I will leave these propositions with the Aga,"
said he, folding up the papers, and putting them back
into his bosom. "In either case I shall keep my vow
with Amesa to help him against Scanderbeg. But
the devil help them both!"</p>

<p>Whistling a snatch of a rude tune, part of which
belonged to an Albanian religious hymn he had heard
in his rambles, and part to a Turkish love song&mdash;swinging
his long arms, and striding as far at each
step as his short legs would allow him, he went down
the mountain.
</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER XXV.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">"W</span>ho comes here?" cried the sentinel at the
bottom of the steep road which led up to the
gate at the rear of the town of Sfetigrade.</p>

<p>The man thus challenged made no reply except to
speak sharply to a large hound he was leading, and
which was struggling to break away from him. In his
engrossment with the brute he did not seem to have
heard the challenge. As he came nearer the sentinel
eyed him with a puzzled, but half-comical look, as he
soliloquized,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, by the devil in the serpent's skin, I know him
this time. He is the Albanian Turk we were nigh to
hamstringing. If I mistake that red head again it
will be when my own head has less brain in it than
will balance it on a pike-staff, where Colonel Kabilovitsch
would put it if I molested this fellow again. I'll
give him the pass word, instead of taking it from him;
that will make up for past mistakes."</p>

<p>The sentinel saluted the new comer with a most
profound courtesy, and, shouldering his spear,
marched hastily past him, ogling him with a sidelong
knowing look.</p>

<p>"Tako mi Marie!"<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>"Tako mi Marie!" responded the man, adding to
himself, "but this is fortunate; the fellow must be
crazy. I thought I should have had to brain him at
least."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>As he passed by, the sentinel stood still, watching
him, and muttered,</p>

<p>"How should I know but Castriot himself is in that
dog's hide."</p>

<p>The dog turned and, attracted by the soldier's attitude,
uttered a low growl.</p>

<p>"Tako mi Marie! and all the other saints in heaven
too, but I believe it is the general in disguise," said
the sentinel.</p>

<p>"Tako mi Marie!" said the stranger saluting the
various guards, whom he passed without further
challenge, through the town gates and up to the main
street.</p>

<p>The great well, from which the beleaguered inhabitants
of Sfetigrade drew the only water now accessible,
since the Turks had so closely invested the town,
was not far from the citadel. It was very deep,
having been cut through the great layers of rock upon
which the upper town stood. Above it was a great
wheel, over the outer edge of which ran an endless
band of leather; the lower end dipping into the water
that gleamed faintly far below. Leathern sockets
attached to this belt answered for buckets, which, as
the wheel was turned, lifted the water to the top,
whence it ran into a great stone trough. The well
was guarded by a curb of stones which had originally
been laid compactly together; but many of them had
been removed, and used to hurl down from the walls
of the citadel upon the heads of the Turks when they
tried to scale them.</p>

<p>The dog, panting with the heat, mounted one of the
remaining stones, and stretched his long neck far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
down to sniff the cool water which glistened a
hundred feet below him. The man shouted angrily
to the beast, and so clumsily attempted to drag him
away that both dog and stone were precipitated
together into the well.</p>

<p>"A grapple! a rope!" shouted the man to a crowd
who had seen the accident from a distance. "Will no
one bring one?" he cried with apparent anger at their
slow movements&mdash;"Then I must get one myself."</p>

<p>The crowd rushed toward the well. The man disappeared
in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>It was several hours before the dead dog was taken
from the polluted water. The Dibrian soldiers refused
to drink from it. The superstition communicated
itself like an epidemic, to the other inhabitants. For
a day or two bands sallied from Sfetigrade, and brought
water from the plain: but it was paid for in blood,
for the Turkish armies, aware of the incident almost
as soon as it occurred, drew closer their lines, and
stationed heavy detachments of Janizaries at the
springs and streams for miles around. The horrors
of a water-famine were upon the garrison. In vain
did the officers rebuke the insane delusion. The
common soldiers, not only would not touch the water,
but regarded the accident as a direct admonition from
heaven that the town must be surrendered. Appeals
to heroism, patriotism, honor, were less potent than a
silly notion which had grown about the minds of an
otherwise noble people&mdash;as certain tropical vines
grow so tough and in such gradually lessening spirals
about a stalwart tree that they choke the ascending sap
and kill it. They who would have drunk were prevented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
by the others who covered the well with heavy
pieces of timber, and stood guard about it.</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n vain did Castriot assault the Turks who were
intrenched about the wells and springs in the
neighborhood. Now and then a victory over them
would be followed by a long procession from the town,
rolling casks, carrying buckets, pitchers, leather bottles
and dug-out troughs. The amount of water thus procured
but scarcely sufficed to keep life in the veins of
the defenders: it did not suffice to nourish heart and
courage. It was foreseen that Sfetigrade must fall.</p>

<p>Constantine was in the madness of despair about
Morsinia. Her fate in the event of capture was
simply horrible to contemplate. Yet she could hardly
hope to make her way through the Turkish lines.
Constantine was at the camp with Castriot when it
was announced that the enemy had at length got possession
of every approach to the town, so that there
was no communication between the Albanians within
and those without, except by signaling over the heads
of the Turks. Castriot determined upon a final
attack, during which, if he should succeed in uncovering
any of the gates of the town, the people might find
egress.</p>

<p>Constantine begged to be allowed the hazardous
duty of entering, by passing in disguise through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
Turkish army, and giving the endangered people the
exact information of Castriot's purpose. Taking
advantage of his former experience, he donned the
uniform of a Janizary, easily learned the enemy's password,
and at the moment designated to the besieged
by Castriot's signal&mdash;just as the lower star of the
Great Dipper disappeared behind the cliff&mdash;he emerged
from the dense shadows of an angle of the wall. He
was scarcely opposite the gate when the drawbridge
lowered and rose quickly. The portcullis was raised
and dropped an instant later, and he was within the
town.</p>

<p>Throwing off his disguise, he went at once toward
the commandant's quarters to deliver despatches from
Castriot. But a shout preceded him&mdash;</p>

<p>"The destroyer! The destroyer! Death to the
destroyer!"</p>

<p>Multitudes, awakened by the shouting, came from
the houses and soldiers' quarters. Constantine was
seized by the crowd, who yelled:</p>

<p>"To the well with him! Let the dog's soul come
into him!"</p>

<p>He was borne along as helplessly as a leaf in the
foaming cataract.</p>

<p>"To the well! To the well with the poisoner!"</p>

<p>The cry grew louder and shriller; the multitude
maddening under the intense fury of their mutual
rage, as each coal is hotter when many glow with it in
the fire. Women mingled with soldiers, shrieking
their insane vengeance, until the crowd surged with
the victim around the well. The planks were torn off
by strong hands. The horror of the deed they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
about to commit made them pause. Each waited for
his neighbor to assume the desperate office of actually
perpetrating what was in all their hearts to do.</p>

<p>At length three of the more resolute stepped forward
as executioners of the popular will. The struggling
form of Constantine was held erect that all might see
him. Torches waved above his head. One stood
upon the well curb, and, dropping a torch into the
dark abyss, cried with a loud voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"So let his life be put out who destroys us all!"</p>

<p>"So let it be!" moaned the crowd; the wildness
of their wrath somewhat subdued by the impressiveness
of the tragedy they were enacting.</p>

<p>The well hissed back its curse as the burning brand
sunk into the water.</p>

<p>But a new apparition burst upon the scene. Suddenly,
as if it had risen from the well, a form draped in
white stood upon the curb. Her long golden hair
floated in the strong wind. Her face, from sickness
white as her robe, had an unearthly pallor from the
excitement, and seemed to be lit with the white heat of
her soul. Her sunken eyes gave back the flare of the
torches, as if they gleamed with celestial reprobation.</p>

<p>"The Holy Virgin!" cried some.</p>

<p>"One of the Vili!" cried others.</p>

<p>The crowd surged back in ghostly fear.</p>

<p>"Neither saint nor sprite am I," cried Morsinia.
"Your own wicked hearts make you fear me. It is
your consciences that make you imagine a simple girl
to be a vengeful spirit, and shrink from this horrid
murder, to the very brink of which your ignorance and
wretched superstition have led you. Blessed Mary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
need not come from Heaven to tell you that a man&mdash;a
man for whom her Son Jesu died&mdash;should not be
made to die for the sake of a dead dog. I, a child,
can tell you that."</p>

<p>"But the well is accursed and the people die," said
a monk, throwing back his cowl, and reaching out his
hand to seize her.</p>

<p>"And such words from you, a priest of Jesu!"
answered the woman, warding him off by the scathing
scorn of her tones. "Did not Jesu say, 'Come unto
Me and drink, drink out of My veins as ye do in Holy
Sacrament?' Will He curse and kill, then, for drinking
the water which you need, because a dog has
fallen into it?"</p>

<p>These words, following the awe awakened by her
unexpected appearance, stayed the rage of the crowd
for a moment. But soon the murmur rose again&mdash;</p>

<p>"To the well!"</p>

<p>"He is a murderer!"</p>

<p>"It is just to take vengeance on a murderer!"</p>

<p>The woman raised her hand as if invoking the witness
of Heaven to her cause, and exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"But <i>I</i> am not a murderer. A curse on him who
slays the innocent. I will be the sacrifice. I fear not
to drink of this well with my dying gasp. Unhand
the man, or, as sure as Heaven sees me, I shall die for
him!"</p>

<p>A shudder of horror ran through the crowd as the
light form of the young woman raised itself to the very
brink of the well. It seemed as if a movement, or a
cry, would precipitate her into the black abyss. The
crowd was paralyzed. The silence of the dead fell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
upon them, as she leaned forward for the awful
plunge.</p>

<p>Those holding Constantine let go their grip.</p>

<p>At this moment the commandant appeared. He
had, indeed, been a silent witness of the scene, and
was not unwilling that the superstition of the soldiers
should thus have a vent, thinking that with the sacrifice
of the supposed offender they might be satisfied,
and led to believe that the spirit of the well was
appeased. He hoped that thus they might be induced
to drink the water. But he recoiled from permitting
the sacrifice of this innocent person, lest it should
blacken the curse already impending.</p>

<p>"I will judge this case," he cried. "Man, who are
you?"</p>

<p>"I bear you orders from General Castriot," replied
Constantine, handing him a document.</p>

<p>By the light of a torch the officer read,</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"In the event of being unable to hold out, signal
and make a sally according to directions to be given
verbally by the bearer.
<span class="i10 smcap">Castriot</span>."</p>
</div>
<p>Turning to the crowd, the commandant addressed
them.</p>

<p>"Brave men! Epirots and Dibrians! We are being
led into some mistake. My message makes it evident
that on this man's life depends the life of every one of
us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice was drowned by wild cries that came
from a distant part of the town. The cries were
familiar enough to all their ears; but they had
heretofore heard them only from beneath the walls
without. They were the Turkish cries of assault.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
"Allah! Allah! Allah! Allah!" rolled like a hurricane
along the streets of Sfetigrade. The gates had
been thrown open by some Dibrian, whom superstition
and a thirst-fevered brain had transformed into a
traitor.</p>

<p>"Quick!" cried Constantine. "Fire three powder
flashes from the bastion, and follow me."</p>

<p>"Brave girl!" said he to Morsinia, grasping her
hand and drawing her toward the citadel.</p>

<p>"It is too late!" replied the commandant. "All
the ports are occupied by the enemy. We can but
die in the streets."</p>

<p>"To the north gate, then! Burst it open, and cut
your way to the east. Castriot will meet you there.
I will to the bastion."</p>

<p>"We must go with them," said Morsinia. "Better
die in the streets than be taken here."</p>

<p>"No, you shall not die, my good angel. I have
prepared for this. First, I will fire the signal." In a
few seconds three flashes illumined the old battlements.</p>

<p>Returning to Morsinia, he said quietly, "I have
prepared for this," and unwound from about his
body a strong cord, looped at intervals so that it
could be used for a ladder. Fastening this securely,
he dropped the end over the wall. Descending part
way himself, he opened the loops one by one for the
feet of his companion; and thus they reached a
narrow ledge some twenty feet below the parapet.
From this to the next projection broad enough to
stand upon, the rock was steep but slanting; so that,
while one could not rest upon it, it would largely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
overcome the momentum of the descent. Fastening
a cord securely beneath the arms of Morsinia, he let
her down the slope to the lower ledge. Then, tying
the rope to that above, he descended himself to her
side. From this point the path was not dangerous to
one possessed of perfect presence of mind, and accustomed
to balance the body on one foot at a time.
Thanks to her mountain life, and the strong stimulus
to brain and nerve acquired by her familiarity
with danger, Morsinia was undizzied by the elevation.
Thus they wound their way toward the east side of
the wall; and, as they neared the base of the cliff,
sat down to reconnoitre.</p>

<p>Above them frowned the walls of the citadel. Just
beneath them were many forms, moving like spectres
in the darkness which was fast dissolving into the
gray morning twilight. The voices which came up
to their ears proved that they were Turks. For
Morsinia to pass through them without detection
would be impossible. To remain long where they
were would be equally fatal.</p>

<p>But their anxiety was relieved by a well known
bugle-call. At first it sounded far away to the north.</p>

<p>"Iscanderbeg! Iscanderbeg!" cried the Turks, as
they were deployed to face the threatening assault.
But scarcely had they formed in their new lines when
the sound, as of a storm bursting through a forest,
indicated that the attack was from the south.</p>

<p>Taking the Turks who were still outside the walls
at a disadvantage, Castriot's force made terrible havoc
among them, sweeping them back pell-mell past the
eastern front and around the northern, so as to leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
the north gate clear for the escape of any who might
emerge from it.</p>

<p>But, alas, for the valor of the commandant and the
noble men who followed him! few succeeded in cutting
their way through the swarm of enemies that had
already occupied the streets of Sfetigrade.</p>

<p>This movement, however, enabled Constantine and
Morsinia to descend from their dangerous eyrie. The
apparition of their approach from that direction was a
surprise to the general.</p>

<p>"Why, man, do you ride upon bats and night-hawks,
that you have flown from yonder crag? I shall henceforth
believe in Radisha and his beautiful demon.
And may I pray thy care for myself in battle, my fair
lady?"</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he fall of Sfetigrade, while a material loss to the
Albanian cause, served rather to exalt than to
diminish the prestige of their great general. The fame
of Scanderbeg brightened as the gloomy tidings of the
fate of the stronghold spread; for that event, due to
a circumstance which no human being could control,
gave his enemies their first success, after nearly seven
years of incessant effort, with measureless armaments,
innumerable soldiery and exhaustless treasure.</p>

<p>The adversity also developed in Scanderbeg new
qualities of greatness, both military and moral. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
the effort to drain a natural spring only evokes its
fuller and freer flow, so disappointment augmented his
courage, impoverishment in resources enlarged the
scheme of his projects, and the defeat of one plan by
circumstances suggested other plans more novel and
shrewd. The sight of the Turkish ensign floating
from the citadel of Sfetigrade disheartened the patriots.
The tramp of fresh legions from almost all parts of the
Moslem world was not so ominous of further disaster
as were the whispers of discontent from more than
one who, like Amesa, had ambitions of their own, or,
like brave Moses Goleme, were discouraged regarding
ultimate success. But the great heart of Castriot
sustained the courage of his people, and his genius
devised plans for the defence of his land which, for
sixteen years yet, were to baffle the skill and weary the
energies of the foe.</p>

<p>The chief gave orders that Morsinia, having eluded
capture, should occupy for the day his own tent; for
the Albanian soldiers, as a rule, were destitute of the
luxury of a canvas covering. Returning toward the
middle of the morning, and having need to enter, he
bade Constantine call her. No response being given,
Castriot raised the curtain of the tent. Upon a rude
matting, which was raised by rough boards a few
inches from the earth, her limbs covered with an
exquisitely embroidered Turkish saddle cloth, Morsinia
lay asleep. Her neck and shoulders were veiled with
her hair, which, rich and abundant, fell in cascades of
golden beauty upon the ground.</p>

<p>The great man stood for a moment gazing upon the
sleeping girl. His ordinarily immobile features relaxed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
His face, generally passionless, unreadable as that of
the sphinx, and impressive only for the mystery of the
thoughts it concealed, now became suffused with kindly
interest. His smile, as if he had been surprised by
the fairness of the vision, was followed by a look of
fatherly tenderness. The tears shot into his eyes; but
with a deep breath he dropped the curtain, and turned
away. Of what was he thinking? Of little Mara Cernoviche,
his playmate far back in the years? or of
himself during those years? Strange that career
among the Turks! and equally strange all the years
since he had looked upon the little child asleep by the
camp fire at the foot of the Balkans! One who gazed
into his face at that moment would have discovered
that the rough warrior spirit was an outer environment
about a gentle and loving nature.</p>

<p>He was interrupted by officers crowding about him,
bringing intelligence of the enemy, or asking questions
relative to the immediate movements of their own commands.
These were answered in laconic sentences,
each one a flash of strategic wisdom.</p>

<p>In the first leisure he put his hand fondly upon Constantine's
head, and said quietly as he seated himself
upon a rock near the tent door&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell me of last night."</p>

<p>As Constantine narrated what the reader is already
familiar with, dwelling especially upon Morsinia's part
in the scene at the well, and her courage in the descent
from the wall, Scanderbeg exclaimed eagerly&mdash;</p>

<p>"A true daughter of Musache De Streeses and
Mara Cernoviche! The very impersonation of our
Albania! Her spirit is that of our heroic people, fair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
as our lakes and as noble as our mountains! But
these scenes are too rough for her. Her soul is
strong enough to endure; but so is the diamond
strong enough to keep its shape and lustre amid the
stones which the freshet washes together. But it is
not well that it should be left to do so. Besides, the
diamond's strength and inviolable purity will not prevent
a robber from stealing it. There are envious
eyes upon our treasure. We had better have our diamond
cut and set and put away in a casket for a while.
We will send her to Constantinople. There she will
have opportunity to gain in knowledge of the world,
and in the courtly graces which fit her princely nature."</p>

<p>"Would not Italy be better?" suggested Constantine.</p>

<p>"No," said Scanderbeg. "The Italians are uncertain
allies. I know not whom to trust across the Adriatic.
But Phranza, the chamberlain at Constantinople,
is a noble man. I knew him years ago when I
was stationed across the Bosphorus, and had committed
to me nearly all the Ottoman affairs, so far as
they affected the Greek capital. He is one of the few
Greeks we may implicitly trust. And, moreover, he
agrees with me in seeking a closer alliance between
our two peoples. If the Christian power at Constantinople
could be roused against the Turk on the east,
while we are striking him on the west, we could make
the Moslem wish he were well out of Europe. But
Italy will do nothing."</p>

<p>"The Holy Father can help, can he not?" asked
Constantine.</p>

<p>"The Holy Father does not to-day own himself. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
is the mere foot-ball of the secular powers, who kick him
against one another in their strife. No, our hope is in
putting some life into the old Greek empire at Constantinople.
The dolt of an emperor, John, is dead,
thanks to Azrael<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>! In Constantine, who has come to
the throne, Christendom has hope of something better
than to see the heir of the empire of the Cæsars
dancing attendance upon Italian dukes; seeking
agreement with the Pope upon words of a creed which
no one can understand; and demoralizing, with his
uncurtained harem, the very Turk. If the new emperor
has the sense of a flea he will see that the
Moslem power will have Constantinople within a
decade, unless the nations can be united in its defence.
I would send letters to Phranza, and you must be my
envoy. With Morsinia there, we shall be free from
anxiety regarding her; for no danger threatens her
except here in her own land&mdash;to our shame I say it.
A Venetian galley touches weekly at Durazzo, and sails
through the Corinthian gulf. You will embark upon
that to-morrow night."</p>

<p>"But Colonel Kabilovitsch?" inquired Constantine.</p>

<p>"He has already started for Durazzo, and will make
all arrangements. Nothing is needed here but a
comely garment for Morsinia, who left Sfetigrade with
a briefer toilet than most handsome women are willing
to make. Colonel Kabilovitsch will see that you
are provided with money and detailed instructions for
the journey."</p>

<p>A soldier appeared with a bundle. "A rough lady's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
maid!" said the general, "but a useful one I will
warrant."</p>

<p>Unrolling the bundle, it proved to be a rich, but
plain, dress, donated from a neighboring castle.</p>

<p>An hour later Scanderbeg held Morsinia by both
hands, looking down into her eyes. It was a picture
which should have become historic. The giant form
of the grim old warrior contrasted fully with that of
the maiden, as some gnarled oak with the flower that
grows at its base.</p>

<p>"Keep good heart, my daughter," said the general,
imprinting a kiss upon her fair brow.</p>

<p>She replied with loving reverence in her tone and
look, "I thank you, Sire, for that title; for the
father of his country has the keeping of the hearts of
all the daughters of Albania."</p>

<p>It were difficult to say whether the sweet loveliness
in the lines of her face, or the majesty of character
and superb heroism that shone through them, gave
her the greater fascination as she added,</p>

<p>"If Jesu wills that among strangers I can best
serve my country, there shall be my home."</p>

<p>"But you will not long be among strangers. Your
goodness will make them all friends. Beside, God
will keep such as you, for he loves the pure and beautiful."</p>

<p>Morsinia blushed as she answered,</p>

<p>"And does God not love the true and the noble?
So he will keep thee and Albania. Does not the sun
send down her<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> beams as straight over Constantinople
as over Croia? and does she not draw the mists by as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
short a cord of her twisted rays from the Marmora as
from the Adriatic? Then God can be as near us
there as here; and our prayers for thee and our land
will go as speedily to the Great Heart over all. The
Blessed Mary keep you, Sire!"</p>

<p>"Ay, the Blessed Mary spake the blessing through
your lips, my child," responded Scanderbeg as he lifted
her to her horse.</p>

<p>Constantine released himself from the general's
hearty embrace, and sprang into the saddle at her side.
Preceded and followed by a score of troopers they disappeared
in the deep shadows of a mountain path.</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>urazzo lies upon a promontory stretching out
into the Adriatic. The walls which surrounded it
at the time of our story, told, by the weather-wear of
their stones, the different ages during which they had
guarded the little bay that lies at the promontory's
base. A young monk,<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Barletius, to whom Colonel
Kabilovitsch introduced the voyagers, as a travelling
companion for a part of their journey, pointed out the
great and rudely squared boulders in the lower course
of masonry, as the work of the ancient Corcyreans,
centuries before the coming of Christ. The upper
courses, he said, were stained with the blood of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Greek soldiers of Alexius, when the Norman Robert
Guiscard assaulted the place, hundreds and hundreds
of years ago.</p>

<p>Indeed, to the monk's historic imagination, the world
seemed still wrapped in the mists of the older ages; and,
just as the low lying haze, with its mirage effect, contorted
the rocks along the shore into domes and pinnacles,
so did his fancy invest every object with the
greatness of the history with which the old manuscripts
had made him familiar.</p>

<p>While Morsinia listened with a strange entertainment
to his rhapsodic narrations, Constantine was
busy studying the graceful lines of the Venetian half-galley
that lay at the base of the cliff, and upon which
they were to embark; her low deck, cut down in the
centre nearly to the water's edge; her sharp, swan-necked
prow raised high in air, and balanced by the
broad elevation at the stern; the lateen sail that,
furled on its boom, hung diagonally against the slender
mast; the rows of holes at the side, through which
in calm weather the oars were worked; the gay pennant
from the mast-head, and the broad banner at the
stern, which spread to the light breeze the Lion of St.
Mark.</p>

<p>They were soon gliding out of the harbor of Durazzo,
at first under the regularly timed stroke of a
score of oarsmen. Rounding the promontory, the west
wind filled the sail; and, careening to the leeward, the
galley danced toward the south through the light spray
of the billows which sung beneath the prow like the
strings of a zither.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was this music of the waves&mdash;or it may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
have been that the wind was blowing straight across
from Italy; or, possibly, it was the beauty of the
maiden reclining upon the cushioned dais of the stern
deck&mdash;that led the weather-beaten sailing master to
take the zither, and sing one after another of Petrarch's
love songs to Laura. Though his voice was as
hoarse as the wind that crooned through the cordage,
and his language scarcely intelligible, the flow of the
melody told the sentiment. Constantine's eyes sought
the face of his companion, as if for the first time he had
detected that she was beautiful. And perhaps for the
first time in her life Morsinia felt conscious that Constantine
was looking at her;&mdash;for she generally withstood
his gaze with as little thought of it as she did
that of the sky, or of Kabilovitsch. Even the monk
turned his eyes from the magnificent shores of Albania,
with their beetling headlands and receding bays, to
cast furtive glances upon the maiden.</p>

<p>The monk's face was a striking one. He was pale,
if not from holy vigil, from pouring over musty secular
tomes. He had caught the spirit of the revival of
learning which, notwithstanding all the superstition of
ecclesiastics, was first felt in the cloisters of the
church. His forehead was high, but narrow; his
eyes mild, yet lustrous; his lower features almost
feminine. One familiar with men would have said,
"Here is a man of patient enthusiasm for things intellectual,
a devotee to the ideal. He may be a philosopher,
a poet, an artist; but he could never make a
soldier, a diplomat, or even a lover, except of the
most Platonic sort. Just the man for a monk. If all
monks were like him, the church would be enriched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
indeed; but, if all like him were monks, the world
would be the poorer."</p>

<p>Among other passengers was a Greek monk, Gennadius.
This man's full beard and long curly forelocks
hanging in front of his ears, were in odd contrast
with the smooth face and shaven head of the
Latin monk. Though strangers, they courteously
saluted each other. However sharp might be the
differences in their religious notions, they soon felt
the fraternity such as cultured minds and great souls
realize in the presence of the sublimities of nature.
They studied each other's faces with agreeable surprise
as the glories about them drew from their lips
vivid outbursts of descriptive eloquence, in which,
speaking the Latin or Greek with almost equal facility,
they quoted from the classic poets with which they
were equally familiar.</p>

<p>As the galley turned eastward into the Corinthian
gulf there burst upon them a panorama of natural
splendor combined with classic enchantment, such as
no other spot on the earth presents. The mountainous
shores lay about the long and narrow sea, like sleeping
giants guarding the outflow of some sacred fountain.
Back of the northern coast rose, like waking sentinels,
the Helicon and Parnassus, towering thousands of
feet into the air; their tops helmeted in ice and plumed
with fleecy clouds. The western sun poured upon the
track of the voyagers floods of golden lustre which
lingered on the still waters, flashed in rainbows from
the splashing oars, gilded with glory the hither slope
of every projection on either shore, and filled the
great gorges beyond with dark purple shadows.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span></p>

<p>As Morsinia reclined with her head resting on Constantine's
shoulder, and drank in the gorgeous, yet
quieting, scene, the two monks stood with uncovered
heads and, half embracing, chanted together in Greek
one of the oldest known evening hymns of the Christian
church. In free translation, it ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"O Jesu, the Christ! glad light of the holy!</p>
<p class="i1">The brightness of God, the Father in heaven!</p>
<p>At setting of sun, with hearts that are lowly,</p>
<p class="i1">We praise Thee for life this day Thou hast given."</p>
</div>

<p>"I love that hymn," said Gennadius, "because it
was written long before the schism which rent the
Holy Church into Latin and Greek."</p>

<p>"We will rejoice, then, that by the inspiration of the
Holy Father, Eugenius, and the assent of your patriarch,
the wound in the body of Christ has, after six
centuries, at last been healed," replied Barletius.</p>

<p>"I fear that the healing is but seeming," said the
Greek. "I was a member of the council of Florence,
and know the motives of the men who composed it, and
the exact meaning of the agreement&mdash;which means
nothing. Your Pope cares not a scrap of tinsel from
his back for the true Christian dogma; and while his
ambition led him to desire to become the uniter of
Christendom, his own bishops, who know him well,
were gathered in synod at Basil, and pronounced him
heretic, perjurer and debauchee."</p>

<p>"But you Greeks were doubtless more honest," said
Barletius, with a tone and look of sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Humph!" grunted Gennadius, walking away; but
turning about quickly he added,</p>

<p>"How could we be honest when, for the sake of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
union, we assented to a denial of our most sacred dogmas
by allowing the <i>Filioque</i>?<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> It is not in the power
of men living to change the truth as expressed
through all past ages in the creed of the true
church. Our emperor yielded the points to the
Latins; but holy Mark of Ephesus and Prince
Demetrius, our emperor's brother, did not. They retired
in disgust from Italy. Why, the very dog of
the emperor, that lay on his foot-cloth, scented the
heresy to which his master was about to subscribe, and
protested against the sacrilege by baying throughout
the reading of the act of union. And I learn that
the clergy and populace at Byzantium are foaming
with rage at this impiety of our Latinizing emperor.
I am hasting thither that I may utter my voice, too,
in my cell in prayer, and from the pulpit of St. Sophia,
against the unholy alliance."</p>

<p>"Yet," said Barletius, with scorn, "your emperor
and church authorities subscribed. What sort of a
divine spirit do you Greeks possess, that prompts you
to confess what you do not believe?"</p>

<p>"I feel your taunt," replied Gennadius. "It is
both just and unjust. Have not some of your own
prelates lately taught that the end justifies the means?
The union, though wrong in itself, was justified&mdash;according
to Latin ethics&mdash;by the result to be secured,
the safety of both Greek and Latin churches from
being conquered by the Turks. Our Eastern empire,
the glory of the later Cæsars, has already become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
reduced to the suburbs of Byzantium. The empire
of Justinian and Theodosius has not to-day ten thousand
soldiers to withstand the myriads of the Sultan.
There must be union. We must have soldiers, even if
we buy them with the price of an article of the creed&mdash;nay
the loan of the article&mdash;for the union will not
stand when danger has passed. Conscience alone is
one thing: conscience under necessity&mdash;I speak the
ethics of you Latins&mdash;is another thing. But I abhor
the deceit. Your bishop, whom you call Pope, has no
reverence from our hearts, though we were to kiss his
toe. You are idolaters with your images of Mary and
the saints. <i>Filioque</i> is a lie!" cried the Greek, giving
vent to his prejudice and spite.</p>

<p>Barletius in the meantime had felt other emotions
than the holiest being kindled within him by these hot
words of his companion; and when the Greek had
flashed his unseemly denunciation at <i>Filioque</i>, the
Latin's soul burst in responsive rage. But he was not
accustomed to harsh debate. Words were consumed
upon his hot lips, or choked in his fury-dried throat.
His frame trembled with the pent wrath. His hands
clenched until the nails cut into the flesh. But alas
for the best saintship, if temptation comes before canonization!
The thin hand was raised, and it fell upon
the holy brother's face. The blow was returned.
But neither of them had been trained to carnal strife,
nor had they the skill and strength to do justice
to their noble rage. Constantine, who leaped forward
to act as peace-maker, stopped to laugh at the strange
pose of the antagonists; for the Greek had valiantly
seized the cowl of the Latin, and drawn it down over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
his face; while Barletius' thin fingers were wriggling
through Gennadius' beard, and both were prancing
as awkwardly as one-day-old calves about the narrow
deck, with the imminent prospect of cooling their
spirits by immersion in the water.</p>

<p>The presence of this danger led Constantine to
separate the scufflers; although his laughter at the contestants
had made his limbs almost as limp as theirs.
The ecclesiastical champions stood glaring their celestial
resentment, the one white, the other red, like two
statues of burlesque gladiators carved respectively in
marble and porphyry.</p>

<p>The conflict might have been renewed had not
Morsinia risen from her cushion, and approached
them. But no sooner did Gennadius realize the danger
of having so much as his gown touched by a
woman, than he bolted to the other end of the galley,
and sat down, with fright and shame, upon a coil of
ropes. The Greek had been trained at the monastery
on Mount Athos. From that masculine paradise the
fair daughters of Eve were as carefully excluded as if
they were still the agents of Satan, and sent by the
devil to work the ruin of those who, by lofty meditation
and unnatural asceticism, would return to the
pre-marital Adamic state of innocence. During
the long twilight, and when the night left only the
outlines of the mountains sharply defined high up
against the star-lit sky, Gennadius still sat motionless;
his legs crossed beneath him; his head dropped upon
his bosom. He gave no response to the salutation of
the attendant who brought him the evening meal: nor
would he touch it. When the sailors sung the songs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
whose melody floated over the sea, keeping time to
the cadences of the light waves which bent but did
not break the surface, the monk put his fingers into
his ears. He tried to drive out worldly thoughts by
recalling those precepts of an ancient saint which, for
four hundred years, had been prescribed at Mount
Athos for those who would quiet their perturbed souls
and rise into the upper light of God. They were
such as these. "Seat thyself in a corner; raise thy
mind above all things vain and transitory; recline thy
beard and chin upon thy breast; turn thy eyes and
thoughts toward the middle of thy belly, the region of
the navel; and search the place of the heart, the seat
of the soul, which when discovered will be involved
in a mystic and ethereal light."</p>

<p>Barletius, equally chagrined by his display of temper
before the laity, sought relief by inflicting upon himself
a task of Pater Nosters, which he tallied off on
his beads, made of olive-wood and sent him by a
learned monk at Bethlehem.</p>

<p>When his punishment seemed accomplished, Morsinia
asked him,</p>

<p>"Good father, why did you quarrel with the
stranger?"</p>

<p>Barletius entered into a long explanation of the
faith of the Roman Church at the point challenged by
the Greek.</p>

<p>"I understand your words," said Morsinia, "but I
do not understand their meaning."</p>

<p>"It is not necessary that you should, my child. If
Holy Church understands, it is enough. A child may
not understand all that the mother knows; yet believes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
the mother's word. So should you believe what
Mother Church says."</p>

<p>"I would believe every word that Mother Church
speaks, even though I do not understand why she
speaks it," said Morsinia reverently. "But how can
one believe another's words when one does not know
what they mean; when they give no thought? Now
what you say about the 'procession of the spirit,' and
the 'begetting of the Son,' I do not get any clear
thought about; and how then can I believe it in my
heart."</p>

<p>The monk cast a troubled look upon the fair
inquirer, and replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then you must simply believe in Holy Church
which believes the truth."</p>

<p>"And say I believe the creed, when I only believe
that the Church believes the creed?" queried the girl.</p>

<p>"It is enough. Happy are you if you seek to know
no more. Beware of an inquisitive mind. It leads one
astray from truth, as a wayward disposition soon
departs from virtue. Credo! Credo! Credo! Help
thou mine unbelief! should be your prayer. Restrain
your thoughts as the helmsman yonder keeps our prow
on the narrow way we are going. How soon you
would perish if you should attempt to find your way
alone out there on the deep! Woe to those who, like
these wretched Greeks, depart from truth, and teach
men so. Anathema, Maranatha!"</p>

<p>"But, tell me, good father, can that be necessary to
be believed, about which whole nations, like the
Greeks, differ from other nations, like the Latins? I
have seen Greeks at their worship, and bowed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
them, and felt that God was near and blessing us all.
And I have heard them say, when they were dying,
that they saw heaven open; and they reached out
their arms to be taken by the angels. Does not Jesu
save them, though they may err about that which we
trust to be the truth?"</p>

<p>"My child, you must not think of these things,"
said Barletius kindly. "It is better that you sleep
now. The air is growing chill. Wrap your cloak
closely even beneath the deck."</p>

<p>He walked away, repeating a line from Virgil as he
scanned the star-gemmed heavens.</p>

<p>"Suadentque cadentia sidera somnos."</p>

<p>Wrapping his hood close over his face, he lay down
upon the deck.</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXIX.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>wo new comers joined the party at Corinth, where,
crossing the isthmus on horses, they re-embarked.
One was Giustiniani, a Genoese, of commanding form
and noble features, the very type of chivalric gentility,
bronzed by journeyings under various skies, and
scarred with the memorials of heroic soldiership on
many fields. The other was a Dacian, short of stature,
with broad and square forehead, and a crooked
neck which added to the sinister effect of his squinting
eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, Urban," said the Genoese, "you still have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
confidence in your new ordnance, and think that saltpetre
and charcoal are to take the place of the sword,
and that every lout who can strike a fire will soon be
a match for a band of archers:&mdash;Eh!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sire, and if the emperor would only allow me
a few hundred ducats, I would cast him a gun which,
from yonder knoll, would heave a stone of five talents'<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
weight, and crash through any galley ever floated
from the docks of Genoa or Venice. Four such guns
on either side would protect this isthmus from a fleet.
But, I tell you, noble Giustiniani, that without taking
advantage of our new science, the emperor cannot
hold out long against the Turk. The Turk is using
gunpowder. He is willing to learn, and has already
learned, what the emperor will find out to his cost,
that the walls of Constantinople itself cannot long
endure the battering of heavy cannon."</p>

<p>"You are right, Urban," replied the Genoese.
"The Turk is also ahead of us in the art of approaching
citadels. I have no doubt that his zigzag trenches<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
give the assailant almost equality with the besieged in
point of safety. I will gladly use my influence at the
court of Byzantium in behalf of your scheme for
founding large cannon, Urban; if, perchance, the
defence of the empire may receive a tithe of the treasure
now squandered in princely parades and useless
embassages."</p>

<p>The galley glided smoothly through the little gulf
of Ægina, with its historic bays of Eleusis and Salamis.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
Giustiniani and Urban discussed the disposition
of the Greek and Persian fleets during the ancient
fight at Salamis, as they moved under the steep rocky
hill on which Xerxes sat to witness the battle. They
soon rounded the headland, opposite the tomb of
Themistocles, and anchored in the harbor of the
Piræus.</p>

<p>This port of Athens was crowded with shipping.
There were Spanish galleasses like floating castles,
with huge turrets at stem and stern, rowed by hundreds
of galley slaves. Other vessels of smaller size
floated the standard of France. Those of the maritime
cities of Italy vied with one another in the exquisite
carving of their prows and the gaiety of their banners.</p>

<p>The chief attention was centred upon a splendid
galley of Byzantium, whose deck was covered with
silken awnings, beneath which a band of music floated
sweet strains over the waters. This was the vessel of
the imperial chamberlain, Phranza, who, having been
entertained in Athens with honors befitting his dignity,
was now about to return to Constantinople.</p>

<p>Giustiniani ordered his galley alongside of that of
the chamberlain, by whom he was received with distinguishing
favors. Constantine took this opportunity to
deliver, through the Genoese, Scanderbeg's letters to
Phranza. They were read with evident gratification
by the chamberlain. With a hearty welcome, not
devoid of some curiosity on his part, as he scrutinized
the appearance of the strangers, he invited Constantine
and his companion to complete their journey in
his galley.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>Morsinia was at first as much dazed by the splendor,
as she was mortified by her ignorance of the formalities,
with which she was received. But the natural
dignity of her bearing stood her in good stead of more
courtly graces: for these modern Greeks emulated
those of ancient times in the reverence they paid to
womanly beauty. The chamberlain was somewhat
past middle life. He was a man whose studious habits,
as the great historian of his times, did not dull his
brilliancy as the master of etiquette. Nor had his
astuteness as a statesman been acquired by any sacrifice
of his taste for social intrigues. The diversions
from the cares of state, which other great men have
found at the gaming-table or in their cups, Phranza
sought in studying the mysteries of female character;
admiring its virtues, and yet not averse to finding entertainment
in its foibles. A true Greek, he believed
that physical beauty was the index of the rarer qualities
of mind and heart. He would have been a consenting
judge at the trial of that beautiful woman in the classic
story, the perfection of whose unrobed form disproved
the charge of her crime. He was such an
ardent advocate of the absolute authority of the
emperor that, though of decided aristocratic tendencies,
he held that no marriage alliance, however
high the rank of the bride, could add to the dignity
of the throne: indeed, that beauty alone could
grace the couch of a king; that the first of men should
wed the fairest of women, and thus combine the aristocracy
of rank with the aristocracy of nature. He
had frequent opportunities to express his peculiar
views on this subject; for, among the problems which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
then perplexed his statecraft, was that of the marriage
of the emperor&mdash;that the succession might not be left
to the hazard of strife among the families of the blood
of the Palæologi. Had the choice of the royal spouse
been left entirely in his hands, he would have made the
selection on no other principle than that adopted by
the purveyor of plumage for the court, who seeks the
rarest colors without regard to the nesting-place of
the bird.</p>

<p>The genuine politeness of the courtier, together with
Morsinia's womanly tact in adapting herself to her new
environment, soon relieved her from the feeling of restraint,
and the hours of the voyage passed pleasantly.
Her conversation, which was free from the conventionalities
of the day, was, for this very reason, as refreshing
to Phranza as the simple forms of nature&mdash;the mountain
stream, the tangles of vines and wild flowers&mdash;are to the
habitués of cities. There was a native poetry in her
diction, an artlessness in her questions, and a transparent
honesty in her responses. Indeed, her very
manner unveiled the features of so exalted and healthy
a mind, of a disposition so frank and ingenuous, of a
character so delicately pure and exquisitely beautiful,
that they compensated many fold any lack of artificial
culture. The great critic of woman forgot to study
her face: he only gazed upon it. He ceased to analyze
her character: he simply felt her worth.</p>

<p>But no fairness of a maiden, be she Albanian or
Greek, can long monopolize the attention of an elderly
man whose swift vessel bears him through the clustering
glories of the Ægean. Nor could any awe for his
rank, or interest in his learned conversation, absorb
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
Morsinia from these splendors which glowed around
her. They gazed in silence upon the smooth and
scarcely bending sea, which, like a celestial mirror,
reflected all the hues of the sky&mdash;steely blue dissolving
into softest purple; white mists transfused by
sunset's glow into billows of fire; monolithic islands
flashing with the colors of mighty agates in the prismatic
air; clouds white as snow and clear cut as
diamonds, lifting themselves from the horizon like the
"great white throne" that St. John saw from the cliffs
of Patmos yonder.</p>

<p>Crossing the Ægean, the voyagers hugged the old
Trojan coast until off the straits of the Hellespont.
They lay during a day under the lee of Yeni Sheyr
shoals, and at night ran the gauntlet of the new Turkish
forts, Khanak-Kalesi and Khalid-Bahar, at the
entrance to the Sea of Marmora. Two days later there
broke upon the view that most queenly of cities,
Byzantium, reclining upon the tufted couch of her
seven hills, by the most lovely of seas, like a nymph
beside her favorite fountain. The galley glided swiftly
by the "Seven Towers," which guard on Marmora
the southern end of the enormous triple wall. The
bastions and towers of this famous line of defenses cut
their bold profile against the sky for a distance of five
or six miles in a straight line, until the wall met the
extremity of the Golden Horn on the north; thus
making the city in shape like a triangle&mdash;the base of
gigantic masonry; the sides of protecting seas.</p>

<p>Gay barges and kaiks shot out from the shore to
form a welcoming pageant to the returning chamberlain.
With easy oars they drifted almost in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
shadows of the cypress trees which lined the bank and
hid the residences of wealthy Greek merchants and
the pavilions of princes. The lofty dome of St. Sophia
flashed its benediction upon the travelers, and its
challenge of a better faith far across the Bosphorus to
the Asiatic Moslem, whose minarets gleamed like
spear-heads from beside their mosques. From the
point where the Golden Horn meets the strait of the
Bosphorus and the sea of Marmora, rose the palace of
the emperor, embowered in trees, and surrounded
with gardens which loaded the air with the perfume
of rarest flowers and the song of birds. Rounding
the point into the Golden Horn, the grim old Genoese
tower of Galata, on the opposite bank, saluted them
with its drooping banner. They dropped anchor in
the lovely harbor. Strong arms with a few strokes
sent the tipsy kaiks from the galley through the
rippling water to the landing. An elegant palanquin
brought the wife of Phranza to meet her lord.
Another, which was designed for the chamberlain, he
courteously assigned to Morsinia; while Constantine
and the gentlemen of the suite mounted the gaily
caparisoned horses that were in readiness. The chamberlain
insisted upon Morsinia and Constantine
becoming his guests, at least until their familiarity
with the city should make it convenient for them to
reside elsewhere.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER XXX.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he house of Phranza was rather a series of houses
built about a square court, in which were parterres
of rarest plants, divided from each other by
walks of variegated marble, and moistened by the
spray of fountains.</p>

<p>Morsinia's palanquin was let down just within the
gateway. A young woman assisted her to alight, and
conducted her to apartments elegantly furnished with
all that could please a woman's eye, though she were
the reigning beauty of a court, instead of one brought
up as a peasant in a distant province, and largely
ignorant of the arts of the toilet. She was bewildered
with the strangeness of her surroundings, and sat down
speechless upon the cushion to gaze about her. Was
she herself? It required the remembrance that Constantine
was somewhere near her to enable her to
realize her own identity, and that she had not been
changed by some fairy's wand into a real princess.</p>

<p>"Will my lady rest?" said the attendant, in softest
Greek.</p>

<p>Morsinia was familiar with this language, which was
used more or less everywhere in Servia and Albania;
but she had never heard it spoken with such sweetness.
The words would have been restful to hear, though
she had not understood their meaning. Without
hesitation she resigned herself to the hands of the
servant, who relieved her of her outer apparel.
Another maiden brought a tray of delicate wafers of
wheat, and flasks of light wine, with figs and dates.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
A curtain in the wall, being drawn, exposed the bath;
a great basin of mottled marble, and a little fountain
scattering a spray scented with roses.</p>

<p>Morsinia began to fear that she had been mistaken
for some great lady, whose wardrobe was expected to
be brought in massive chests, and whose personal ornaments
would rival the toilet treasures of the Queen of
Sheba. There entered opportunely several tire-women,
laden with silks and linens, laces and shawls, every
portion of female attire, in every variety of color and
shape&mdash;from the strong buskin to the gauze veil so
light that it will hide from the eye less than it reveals
to the imagination.</p>

<p>The guest was about to question her attendants,
when one gave her a note, hastily written by Constantine,
and simply saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Be surprised at nothing." Phranza had expressed
to Constantine the deep interest of the emperor in
the career of Scanderbeg, and his plans for Morsinia.</p>

<p>"Scanderbeg," said he, "is the one hero of our
degenerate age; the only arm not beaten nerveless by
the blows of the Turk. I have asked nothing concerning
yourself, my young man; nor need I know more
than that such a chieftain is interested in you and your
charge. Your great captain informs me (reading from
a letter), that any service we may render you here will
be counted as service to Albania; and that any favor
we may bestow upon the lady will be as if shown to his
own child. Is she of any kin to him?"</p>

<p>"I may not speak of that," replied the youth, "except
to tell that her blood is noble, and that General
Castriot has made her safety his care. An Albanian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
needs but to know that this is the will of our loving
and wise chieftain, to defend Morsinia with his
life."</p>

<p>"You speak her name with familiarity," said
Phranza.</p>

<p>"It is the custom of our people," replied Constantine,
coloring. "The trials of our country have thrown
nobles and peasants into more intimate relations than
would perhaps be allowed in a settled condition.
This, too, may have influenced General Castriot in
sending her here, where her life may be more suitable
to her gentle blood."</p>

<p>"It is enough!" exclaimed Phranza. "If our distance
from Albania, and our own pressing difficulties and
dangers do not allow us to send aid to your hero, we
can show him our respect and gratitude by treating
her, whom he would have as his child, as if she were
our own. And now for yourself&mdash;well! you shall have
what, if I mistake you not, your discreet mind and
lusty muscles most crave&mdash;an opportunity 'to win your
spurs,' as the western knights would say. Events are
thickening into a crash, the out-come of which no one
can foresee, except that the Moslem or the Christian shall
hold all from the Euxine to the Adriatic. This double
empire cannot long exist. Scanderbeg's arms alone
are keeping the Sultan from trying again the strength
of our walls. A disaster there; an assault here!
You serve the one cause whether here or there."</p>

<p>"I give my fealty to the emperor as I would to my
general," replied the young man warmly.</p>

<p>Constantine found himself arrayed before night in
the costume of a subaltern officer of the imperial guard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
and assigned to quarters at the barracks in the section
of the city near to the house of the chamberlain. His
brief training under the eye of Castriot, and his
hazardous service, had developed his great natural
talent for soldiership into marvellous acquirements for
one of his years. With the foils, in the saddle, in
mastery of tactics, in engineering ability displayed at
the walls&mdash;which were being constantly strengthened&mdash;he
soon took rank with the most promising. By
courtesy of the chamberlain he was allowed the freest
communication with Morsinia, and was often the guest
of her host; especially upon excursions of pleasure up
the Golden Horn to the "Sweet Waters," along the
western shore of the Bosphorus, to the Princess
Island, and such other spots on the sea of Marmora as
were uninfested by piratical Turks.</p>

<p>Morsinia became the favorite not only of the wife of
Phranza, but of the ladies of the court, and
the object of especial devotion on the part of the
nobles and officers of the emperor's suite.</p>

<p>But it would have required more saintliness of
female disposition than was ever found in the court
of a Byzantine emperor, to have smothered the fires of
jealousy, when, at a banquet given at the palace,
Morsinia was placed at the emperor's right hand. It
might not be just to Phranza to say that to his suggestion
was due the praise of Morsinia's beauty and
queenly bearing, which the emperor overheard from
many of the courtiers' lips. Perhaps the charms of
her person forced this spontaneous commendation
from them: as it was asserted by some of the more
elderly of the ladies&mdash;whom long study had made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
proficient in the art of reading kings' hearts from
their faces, that the monarch found an Esther in the
Albanian.</p>

<p>The reigning beauty at the court of Constantine
Palælogus at this time was the daughter of a Genoese
admiral. Though not reputed for amiability, she won
the friendship of Morsinia by many delicate attentions.
Gifts of articles of dress, ornaments and such
souvenirs as only one woman can select for another,
seemed to mark her increasing attachment. A box of
ebony, richly inlaid with mother of pearl, and filled
with delicious confections, was one day the offering
upon the shrine of her sisterly regard. The wife of
Phranza, in whose presence the box was opened, on
learning the name of the donor, besought Morsinia
not to taste the contents; and giving a candied fig to
a pet ape, the brute sickened and died before the
night.</p>

<p>An event contributed to the rumors which associated
the name of the fair Albanian with the special favors
of the emperor. An embassage from the Doge of
Venice had brightened the harbor with their galleys.
A gondola sheathed in silver, floated upon the waters
of the Golden Horn, like a white swan, and was
moored at the foot of the palace garden&mdash;the gift of
the Doge. Another, its counterpart, was in the harbor
of Venice&mdash;the possession of the daughter of the
Doge; but waiting to join its companion, if the
imperial heart could be persuaded to accept with it
the person of its princely owner. Better than the
ideal marriage of Venice with the sea&mdash;the ceremony
of which was annually observed&mdash;would be the marriage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
of the two seas, the Adriatic and the Ægean;
and the reunion of their families of confluent waters
under the double banner of St. Mark and Byzantium.
But the Grand Duke Lucas Notaris, who was also
grand admiral of the empire, declared openly that he
would sooner hold alliance with the Turk than with a
power representing that schismatic Latin Church.
The hereditary nobles protested against such a menace
to social order as, in their estimate, a recognition
of a republic like Venice would be. But it was
believed that more potent in its influence over the
emperor than these outcries, was the whisper of
Phranza that the silver gondola of Venice was fairer
than its possessor; and that queenly beauty awaited
elsewhere the imperial embrace.</p>

<p>No habitué of the court knew less of this gossip
than Morsinia herself; nor did she suspect any
unusual attention paid her by the emperor to be
other than an expression of regard for Castriot,
whose ward she was known to be. Or if, when they
were alone, his manner betrayed a fondness, she
attributed it to his natural kindliness of disposition, or
to that desire for recreation which persons in middle
life, burdened with cares, find in the society of the
young and beautiful; for no purpose of modesty
could hide from Morsinia the knowledge which her
mirror revealed. She had, too, the highest respect
for the piety of the emperor; the deepest sympathy
with him in his distress for the evils which were
swarming about his realm; and a true admiration for
the courage of heart with which he bore up against
them. It was therefore with a commingling of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
religious, patriotic, and personal interest that she gave
herself up to his entertainment whenever he sought
her society. That she might understand him the better,
and be able to converse with him, she learned
from Phranza much of the history of recent movements,
both without and within the empire. So
expert had she become in these matters that the
chamberlain playfully called her his prime minister.</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXXI.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ne evening the lower Bosphorus and the Golden
Horn were alive with barges and skiffs, which
cut the glowing water with their spray-plumed prows
and flashing blades. Thus the tired day toilers
were accustomed to seek rest, and the idlers of
fashion endeavored to quicken their blood in the
cool wind which, from the heights of the Phrygian
Olympus, poured across the sea of Marmora. The
Emperor, attended by one of his favorite pages,
appeared upon the rocky slope which is now known as
Seraglio Point. A number of boats, containing the
ladies and gentlemen of the court, drew near to the
shore. It was the custom of his majesty to accept
the brief hospitality of one and another of these
parties, and for the others to keep company with
him; so that the evening sail was not unlike a saloon
reception upon the water. The dais of Phranza's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
boat was, on the evening to which we refer, occupied
by Morsinia alone; and, as the rowers raised the oars
in salute of his majesty, he waved his hand playfully
to the others, saying:</p>

<p>"The chamberlain is so occupied to-day that he
has no time to attend to his own household. I will
take his place, with the permission of the dove of
Albania."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty needs rest," said Morsinia, making
place for him at her side on the dais, which filled the
stern of the barge, and over which hung a silken
awning. "Your face, Sire, betokens too much thought
to-day."</p>

<p>Throwing himself down, he replied lazily: "I
would that our boat were seized by some sea sprite,
and borne swift as the lightnings to where the sun
yonder is making his rest, beyond the Hellespont,
beyond the pillars of Hercules, beyond the world!
But you shall be my sprite for the hour. Your conversation,
so different to that of the court, your
charming Arnaout accent, and thoughts as natural as
your mountain flowers, always lead me away from
myself."</p>

<p>"I thank heaven, Sire, if Jesu gives to me that holy
ministry," replied she blushing deeply and diverting
the conversation. "But why are you so sad when
everything is so beautiful about us? Is it right to
carry always the burden of empire upon your heart?"</p>

<p>"Alas!" replied he, "I must carry the burden
while I can, for the time may not be far distant when
I shall have no empire to burden me. Events are
untoward. While Sultan Amurath lives our treaty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
will prevent any attack upon the city. But if another
should direct the Moslem affairs, our walls yonder
would soon shake with the assault of the enemy of
Christendom. Nothing but the union of the Christian
powers can save us."</p>

<p>"And you have the union with Rome?" suggested
Morsinia.</p>

<p>"A union of shadows to withstand an avalanche,"
replied the Emperor. "The Pope is impotent. He
can only promise a score of galleys and his good
offices with the powers. At the same time our monks
have almost raised an insurrection against the throne
for listening to the proposition of alliance to which
my lamented brother subscribed during the last days
of his reign."</p>

<p>"But God," replied Morsinia, "is wiser than we,
and will not allow the throne of the righteous to be
shaken. I have looked to-day at the marvellous dome
of St. Sophia. As I gazed into its mighty vault, and
thought of the great weight of the stones which made
it, I looked about to see upon what it rested. The
light columns and walls, far spread, seemed all
insufficient to support it. As I stood looking, I
was at first so filled with fear that I dared not
linger. But then I remembered that a great architect
had made it; and that so it had stood for
many centuries, and had trembled with songs of praise
from millions upon millions of worshippers who in all
these generations have gathered under it. Then I
stood as quietly beneath it as I am now under the
great vault of the sky. And surely, Sire, this Christian
empire was founded in deeper wisdom than that of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
architect. Are not the pillars of God's promises its
sure support? Have not holy men said that so long
as the face of Jesu<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> looks down from above the great
altar, the sceptre shall not depart from him who
worships before it?"</p>

<p>"But," said Palælogus, "God rejects His people
for their sins. The empire's misfortunes have not
been greater than its crimes. As the rising mists
return in rain, so the sins of Constantinople, rising
for centuries, will return with storms of righteous retribution.
And I fear it will be in our day; for the
clouds hang low, and mutter ominously, and there is
no bright spot within the horizon."</p>

<p>"Say not so, my Emperor!" cried Morsinia earnestly.
"A breath of wind is now scattering yonder
cloud over Olympus; and the lightest moving of God's
will can do more. Do you not remember the words
of a holy father, which I have often heard one of our
Latin priests repeat to those fearful because of their
past lives;&mdash;'Beware lest thou carry compunctions for
the past after thou hast repented and prayed. That
is to doubt God's grace.' But I am a child, Sire,
and should not speak thus to the Emperor."</p>

<p>"A child?" said his majesty, gazing upon her
superb form and strong womanly features. "Well! a
child can see as far into the sky as the most learned and
venerable; and your faith, my child, rests me more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
than all the earth-drawn assurances of my counsellors.
Where have you learned so to trust? I would willingly
spend my days in the convent of Athos or
Monastir to learn it! But I fear me the holy monks
have it not of so strong and serene a sort as yours."</p>

<p>"I have learned it, Sire, as my heart has read it
from my own life. My years are scarcely more numerous
than my rescues have been, when to human
sight there was no escape from death, or what I dreaded
worse than death. I have learned to hold a hand that
I see not; and it has never failed. Nor will it fail
the anointed of the Lord; for such thou art. But
see! yonder comes my brother Constantine. I know
him from his rowing. They who learn the oars on
mountain lakes never get the stroke they have who
learn it at the sea."</p>

<p>The Emperor turning in the direction indicated,
frowned, and said angrily,</p>

<p>"Your brother has forgotten the regulations, and is
in danger of discipline for rowing within the lines
allowed only to the court."</p>

<p>The boat came nearer; not steadily, but turning to
right and left, stopping and starting as if directed by
something at a distance which the rower was watching.</p>

<p>The Emperor's attention was turned almost at the
same instant to a light boat shooting toward them
from an opposite direction. The occupant of this
was a monk. His black locks, mingled with his
black beard, gave a wildness to his appearance, which
was increased by the excited and rapid manner of his
propelling the craft.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span></p>

<p>"Something unusual has occurred, or they would
wait the finding of another messenger than he," said
the Emperor.</p>

<p>The monk's boat glided swiftly. When within a
few yards of the barge in which the Emperor was the
man stood up, his eyes flashing, and his whole attitude
that of some vengeful fiend. "Hold!" shouted the
rowers of the royal barge, endeavoring to turn the
craft so as to avoid a collision.</p>

<p>"The man is crazed!" said Morsinia.</p>

<p>But at the instant when the two boats would have
come together, another, that of Constantine, shot
between them and received the blow. Its thin sides
were broken by the shock.</p>

<p>The monk who had come to the very prow, and
drawn a knife from his bosom, cried out, "To the
devil with the Prince of the Azymites."<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>He leaped upon Constantine's boat in order to reach
that containing the Emperor: but was caught in the
strong arms of Constantine who fell with him into
the water. The monk gripped with his antagonist so
that they sank together. In a few seconds, however,
Constantine emerged. A thin streamer of blood
floated from him. He was drawn upon the barge.
Morsinia's hand tore off the loose gold-laced jacket,
and found the wound to be a deep, but not dangerous
flesh cut across the shoulder. It was several moments
before the monk appeared. He gasped and sank
again forever.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<p>Constantine stated that the day before, while aiding
in the erection of a platform for some small
culverin that Urban had cast, the latter spoke to him
of the marvellous mosaic ornamentation in the vestibule
of the little church just beyond the walls, and
took him thither. The monk was there, and passed
in and out, evidently demented, and muttering to himself
curses upon the Latinizers. Constantine thought
little of this at the time; for a mad monk was not
an uncommon sight in the city. But observing the
same man at the quay hiring a boat, he determined to
watch him. Hence the sequel.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXII.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he members of Phranza's family were dining, as was
their custom on pleasant days, under the great
fig tree in the garden; a favorite spot with the chamberlain
when allowed that privacy of life and domestic
retirement which were seldom enjoyed by one whose
duty it was to show the courtesies of the empire to
ambassadors and distinguished visitors from the ends
of the earth.</p>

<p>"I would willingly exchange conditions with old
Guerko, the gate keeper, to-day," said Phranza, pushing
from him the untasted viands. "The gate-keeper
of an empire has less liberty and rest."</p>

<p>"What new burden has the council put upon you,
my lord?" said his wife.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span></p>

<p>"Remember that your little prime minister will
help you," interposed Morsinia playfully.</p>

<p>Phranza glanced with a kindly but troubled look at
her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"The wheels of the public good grind up the
hearts of individuals remorselessly," continued the
good man. "Here am I with a spouse as fair as
Juno; yet I must leave her for months, and maybe
years, that I may seek a spouse for the Emperor. I
am to make a tour of all Christian courts; sampling
delicate bits of female loveliness, and weighing paternal
purses. But sacred policy takes the place of holy
matrimony among the great. An emperor and empress
are not to be man and wife, but only the welding
points of two kingdoms, though their hearts are burned
and crushed in the nuptials. I had hoped that his
majesty would assert his sovereignty sufficiently to
declare that, in this matter, he would exercise the
liberty which the commonest boor possesses, and
choose who should share his couch, and be the mother
of his children. But the very day after his escape
from the mad monk, he put the keeping of his royal
heart into the hands of his ministers. The shock of the
attempt upon his life, or something else (glancing at
Morsinia), seems to have turned his head with fear
for the succession. So, to-morrow I sail to the
Euxine to inspect the Circassian beauties, who are
said to bloom along its eastern shore. But my dear
wife will be consoled for my absence by the return of
our nephew Alexis, who, I learn from my letters, is
already at Athens, having wearied of his sojourn
among the Italians, and will be with you before many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
days. Heaven grant that he has not become tainted
with the vices of the Italians, which are even worse
than those of the Byzantines. I trust he will find his
aunt's care, and the sisterly offices of our Albanian
daughter, more potently helpful than my counsel
would have been."</p>

<p>The magnificent retinue, the splendid galleys, the
untold treasures scraped from the bottom of the
imperial coffers, with which, on the following day, the
chamberlain sailed away through the Bosphorus to the
Euxine, were but poor compensation to his loving
household for his prolonged absence. Nor was his place
adequately filled by Alexis with his fine form and
western elegance of manners. In one respect Phranza's
wish was met; for if the care of his aunt was not
appreciated by the young man, the sisterly offices
of the fair Albanian were.</p>

<p>Morsinia's respect for the absent Phranza led her to
allow more attention from Alexis than her heart, or
even her judgment, would have suggested. The
young nobleman soon entangled himself in the web of
her unconscious fascination. It was not until with
passionate ardor he told his love, that Morsinia realized
her fatal power over him. But with a true woman's
frankness and firmness, she endeavored to dispel the
illusion his ardent fancy had created.</p>

<p>"If I have not yet won you," cried the impetuous
youth, "do not tell me that my suit is hopeless. It
was folly in me to dream that you would see in me
anything worthy of your love, so soon as your transcendent
beauty of face and soul made me feel that
you were all worthy of mine. Let me prove myself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
by months or years of devotion, if you will. If I do
not now merit your esteem, surely the charm of daily
looking upon you will make me better; the sweetness
of your spirit will change mine; then as you see in me
some impression of your own goodness, you will not
scorn and repel me. I beg that you will make of me
what you will, and love me as you can. I am not
harder than the marble of which Pygmalion made the
statue he loved. Mould me, Morsinia!"</p>

<p>"It is not that you are not worthy of me, Alexis.
The nephew of Phranza need not humiliate himself
at the feet of any king's daughter. But&mdash;but&mdash;it may
not be! It cannot be!" and, gently releasing the
hand she had allowed him to seize, she withdrew to
her own chamber.</p>

<p>Alexis stood for a moment as if stupefied with his
disappointment. This feeling was followed by a
chagrin, which showed itself in the deep color mounting
his haughty face. Then rage ensued, and he
stamped upon the ground as if crushing some helpless
thing beneath his feet, and muttered to himself:</p>

<p>"If not I, no man shall have her and live. Can it
be that Albanian Constantine? Who is that vagrant?
that menial? that hell-headed hireling who follows
her? Angels and toads do not brood together; and
he is of no kin to her."

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>hrough a narrow street, lighted by the lanterns
which hung before the doors of the few wine shops
that were still open&mdash;for the hour was late&mdash;a man,
wrapped in a hooded cloak, went stumbling over the
dogs that were asleep in the middle of the way, and
not unfrequently over the watchmen lying upon the
mats before the closed entrances to the bazaars they
were guarding. He entered one wine shop after
another, muttering an oath of disappointment as he
withdrew from each. At length he turned into an
alley, which seemed like a mere crevice in the compact
mass of houses, and threaded his way between
windowless and doorless walls, until the passage
widened into a small and filthy court. At the extreme
rear of this a lamp was just flickering with its exhausted
oil, and only sufficed to show him a doorway.
Rapping gently he called in Italian:</p>

<p>"Pedro! Giovan!"</p>

<p>The door was opened by a short, stout man with
bullet head, who spread himself across the entrance
and peered into the face of the late comer. Two
villainous looking men stared through the lurid glare
of a rush light on a low table, at which, squatted on
the ground, they were playing dice. A purse or
pouch of gold thread, decorated with some device
wrought with pearls and various precious stones, lay
beside them.</p>

<p>"Ah, the gentleman from Genoa!" exclaimed one.
"You are quite welcome to our castle. Ricardo,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
where is the stool? Well! if you can't find it, lie down,
and let the gentleman sit on your head."</p>

<p>"You appear to be in luck, Pedro, if I am to judge
from the purse yonder," said the visitor. "Your
lady has taken you back to her affection, and given
you this as a love token, I suppose."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you the secrets of my lady's chamber, Signior,
when you tell me those of yours," replied Pedro.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," interposed Giovan, "the gentleman would
have us help him in to the secrets of his lady's chamber.
How now, Signior Alexis, have you trapped a new
beauty so soon in Byzantium?"</p>

<p>"Let's throw for this before we talk," interposed
Ricardo, holding the purse in one hand and a dice
cup in the other. "One business at a time."</p>

<p>The three men threw. The stake fell to Ricardo,
who thrust the rich prize into his dirty pocket, where
a third of the contents of the purse had previously
been deposited.</p>

<p>"May I see the little bag?" asked Alexis.</p>

<p>"No!" was the surly response.</p>

<p>"You see, Signior," interposed Giovan, in an
attempt to mitigate the rudeness of his comrade,
"You see it was a trust from&mdash;from a dead man, who
was afraid to take it with him to purgatory, lest the
fire might tarnish it. So we keep it for him until he
comes back. And we are still in the trust business,
Signior! Our credit is without a stain. You know it
was just a suspicion of our integrity&mdash;we would not
have our honor even suspected by the police&mdash;that led
us to leave Genoa. Will you trust us with any little
business?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you know the Albanian officer in the emperor's
guards?" asked Alexis.</p>

<p>"No, and want to know nothing about officers of
any sort," growled Giovan.</p>

<p>"Ay!" interposed Ricardo, "the red-topped
fellow, with a body like Giovan's, and the neck the
right height to come under my sword arm?" making
the gesture of cutting off one's head with a sabre.
"Does he disturb you?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"It will be worth a hundred ducats," said Giovan.</p>

<p>"A hundred and fifty," said Ricardo; and, lowering
his voice to the others, added, "I need fifty, and I
would take only my even share."</p>

<p>"You shall have it," said Alexis, counting out the
gold. "If you deceive me, you know that one word
from me here in Byzantium will cost you your heads.
Good night!"</p>

<p>When he had gone, Giovan said in low voice:</p>

<p>"I say, Pedro, we will divide a thousand ducats out
of this."</p>

<p>"How?" exclaimed the two.</p>

<p>"The young officer is brother to the lady at the
grand chamberlain's. She will pay heavy ransom if
we deliver him instead of&mdash;" drawing his finger across
his throat. "Of course we should have to leave
Byzantium. But Ricardo and I have concluded that
it were best to be gone anyhow; for the people here
are so poor that our business does not thrive. This
purse once held ducats, but when we took it, it had
only silver bits. We pocket-bankers need better constituency."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, we had better get out of this," said Pedro.
"General Giustiniani has come to live in Galata.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
He got his weasel-eyes on me yesterday as I was doing
a little business by the old wharf. That man knows
too much, he does. But he'll never get me on the
galley benches again. I'd crawl like a mud turtle on
the bottom of Marmora before I'd go under the
hatches a second time. I like freedom and fresh air,
I do&mdash;" blowing out of his face the thick smoke
emitted by the wick floating on the surface of a saucer
of oil.</p>

<p>"Right!" said Giovan. "Let's get out of this if
we can do so with enough gold to pay our royal travelling
expenses. But if we spare the neck of that fellow
who is in Signior Alexis' way, where will we keep him
that Alexis will not know it?"</p>

<p>"Our mansion here is hardly commodious enough
for so distinguished and lively a guest as the young
officer will be likely to be," said Ricardo, scraping the
spiders' webs from the low ceiling of the room with his
cap.</p>

<p>"Try the old water vault," suggested Pedro.</p>

<p>"Good!" said Ricardo, "when the Albanian goes to
the walls, as he does every day, he will pass near to
the opening."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he day following the three ruffians lingered about
the site of the old Hippodrome&mdash;through the open
space of which the citizens passed in going from one
part of the city to another. Toward evening a stone
was thrown against the bronze-sheathed column, or
walled pyramid, which still held some of the great
plates that in the palmy days of Byzantium made it one
of the wonders of the city. It was the signal for
alertness. A short-bodied, long-armed, red-haired
man, dressed in the white kilt and gold-embroidered
jacket of a citizen, sauntered leisurely through the
Hippodrome. He measured with his eye the space
which once blazed with the splendor of fashion, when,
beneath the imperial eye of a Justinian or Theodosius,
the horses of Araby and Thracia ran, and the factions
of "the Blues" and "the Greens" shouted, and the
whirling wheels of the golden chariots sprinkled the
dust upon the multitudes.</p>

<p>The man paused to gaze at the bronze column of
three intertwined serpents, with silver-crested heads,
which was believed to have been brought from the
temple at Delphi to his new city by the great Constantine.
He stood reverently before the tall Egyptian
obelisk of rose-granite, whose light red glowed with
deeper hue in the eastern flush of the twilight sky;
puzzled over its vertical lines of hieroglyphs which
thirty centuries had not obliterated, and studied the
figures on its marble base, representing the machines
used by the engineers of Theodosius in hoisting the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
great monolith to its place, a thousand years ago.
Broken statues&mdash;the spoil of conquered cities in generations
of Greek prowess which shamed the supineness
of the present, stood or lay about the grand
pillar of porphyry, which was once surmounted by the
statue of Apollo wrought by Phidias.</p>

<p>"Shame for such neglect!" muttered the man. "A
people that cannot keep its art from cracking to pieces
with age, cannot long keep the old empire of the
Cæsars."</p>

<p>The narrow street to the north of the Hippodrome
square shut out the remnant of daylight as the man
turned into it. His attention was drawn by the groaning
of some poor outcast crouching in the dark shadow
of an angle in the wall. As he stooped to inspect this
object a stunning blow fell upon his head. Two
stalwart men instantly pinioned his arms. They
rolled his helpless body a few yards, and carried or
slid it down a flight of steps into a dark cavern, whose
sides echoed their footfalls and whispers, as if it were
the place of the last Judgment where the secrets of
life are all to be proclaimed. Reaching the bottom,
one of the men produced a light. The glare seemed
to excavate a hollow sphere out of the thick darkness,
but revealed nothing, except the spectral flash of the
bats flitting around the heads of the intruders, and
the damp earthen floor upon which the men had
thrown their victim. At length great forms rose
through the gloom, like the trunks of a forest. The
water of a subterranean lake gleamed from near their
feet, but its smooth black sheen was soon lost in the
darkness. A small boat, or raft, was near, into which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
the man was lifted; one of the ruffians sitting on his
feet, the other by his head, while the third propelled
the craft by pushing against great granite pillars
between which they passed. After going some distance
the boat ground its bottom against a mass of
fallen masonry and dirt, which made a sort of island,
perhaps twenty feet across. Here they landed, and
dragged their victim.</p>

<p>"What would you have with me?" said the prostrate
man.</p>

<p>"It is enough that we have you," said Pedro, in
broken Greek. "We want nothing more; not even to
keep your miserable carcass, since we have already got
our pay for burying it. I'll be your father-confessor
and shrive you. If you like the Latin&mdash;Absolvo te!
and away go your sins as easily as I can strip this
gold-laced jacket off your back. Or if you prefer the
Greek&mdash;By the horns of Nebuchadnezzar, I've forgotten
the priestly words! But I'll shrive you all the
same without the holy mumble. And if you want to
pray a bit yourself, why fold your feet in front of
your nose and kneel on your back."</p>

<p>"Why do you kill me?" said the man. "I am
nothing to you."</p>

<p>"Nothing to us, but something to him who has hired
us. As honest men we must do what we were paid to
do."</p>

<p>"Unless I can pay you more," said the man,
instantly taking a hopeful hint.</p>

<p>"Do you wear the belt of Phranza, that you think
you can pay so much?" replied one of the ruffians,
feeling about the person of the helpless man.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span></p>

<p>"What I have I give&mdash;a hundred ducats."</p>

<p>"A hundred! Are you love-crossed that you value
life so little? You'll skin well, my gentle lambkin;
and as you are half tanned already, we will sell your
hide to the buskin maker for almost that sum; and
your fat (feeling his ribs) will grease a hundred galley
masts. A thousand ducats is your value, you Albanian
imp!"</p>

<p>"I do not possess so much," said the victim.</p>

<p>"But your sister does," said the ruffian; and not
noting the surprised look of the man, continued:
"We have arranged for that. Your life is worth to
us just one thousand ducats of gold. Sign this!"
producing a bit of paper on which was something
written.</p>

<p>"I cannot read it in this light. You read it. I may
trust such honest fellows as you are."</p>

<p>The man read&mdash;"To my sister, the Albanian, at the
house of Phranza. I am in danger from which I can
escape only if you will give the bearer one thousand
ducats. Speak not to any one of it, or my life is forfeit.
That you may know this is genuine the bearer
will show you my ring and a clip of my hair."</p>

<p>"Give me your ring; and, comrade, warm the wax
to seal the letter," said Giovan.</p>

<p>"But I am not the man you seek," said the victim.</p>

<p>"And who in the devil's name are you then?"</p>

<p>"A mere stranger."</p>

<p>"Prove it!"</p>

<p>"Take the ring, and the lady will not recognize
it."</p>

<p>"We shall see," said the ruffian, "but we will take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
the hundred ducats now to pay for any trouble you
have put us to."</p>

<p>His belt was stripped off, and its golden contents
ripped out. The victim was untied, first having been
completely disarmed. The three men entering the
boat, pushed off in the direction from which they had
entered.</p>

<p>The island prisoner watched the receding light as it
flashed its long rays on the water, illumined the arches
of the roof, and lit the crouching figures in the boat.
The multiplying pillars became like a solid wall as the
light receded, until at length the darkness was complete.
The sound of the boat as it scratched against
the stone at the landing, gave place to the most
oppressive silence.</p>

<p>To attempt escape in the direction of the entrance
would be folly. If he could find his way his captors
would doubtless be on guard and easily overpower
him, as he would have to wade or swim. But to
remain where he was would be as hazardous, for the
wretches would not risk exposure for the sake of the
hundred ducats they had secured; but would probably
return and put him out of the way of witnessing
against them.</p>

<p>As he meditated, a low rumble like distant thunder,
ran along the arches. "Some passing vehicle in the
city above," he concluded.</p>

<p>A light drip, as of a bat's wing touching the water!
Another! and another! "Strange that they should
be so regular!" thought the man. "There must be
some inlet: I will explore."</p>

<p>He walked cautiously into the water in the direction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
of the sound. Soon he was beyond his depth; but,
being an expert swimmer, kept on; his outstretched
arms answering as antennæ of some huge water-spider,
and guarding him from collision with the
pillars.</p>

<p>The dripping sound became louder. Now it was
just above his head. He felt his way with his hands
until it became evident that he was at the end or side
of the subterranean lake. But the shore was steep;
indeed, a wall. Fixing his fingers into the crevices
between the stones, he was able to raise himself half
out of the water. Reaching up with one hand he felt
the curved edge of a viaduct, by which the dark lake
was evidently fed, or had been in earlier days. But,
bah! The water now trickling through it was foul.
The spring had been stopped, and the viaduct become
a sewer; fed doubtless through its rents with the
soakage of the city.</p>

<p>But might there not be an opening into the upper
air? If not, a great human mole&mdash;especially if, to
blind scratching power, he adds the skill of one trained
in the art of engineering&mdash;can possibly make an opening.</p>

<p>The prisoner climbed into the viaduct. It was large
enough to allow him to crawl a short distance. A
faint glimmer of light proved the correctness of his
surmise that it was connected with the surface. But
fallen stones blocked his way. As he lay planning with
fingers and brain for his further progress, voices sounded
from the reservoir. They were those of two of the
cut-throats returning. He pushed himself back to the
opening. His captors had missed him at the island.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
If they knew of this sluice, or chanced to come upon
it in their search, he was lost in his present position;
for a pair of bare heels was the only weapon he could
show against their sharp daggers. He let himself
down into the water, and swam silently away. The
light, however, from his captors' lamp came nearer.</p>

<p>"Hist!" said one. "He is yonder; perhaps by the
devil's window."</p>

<p>The boat pushed directly toward the viaduct he had
left.</p>

<p>While they explored the opening, which might well
be called the window into the blackness of darkness
of the nether world, their victim swam rapidly, keeping
always in the shadow of the great pillars. But
the boat was upon his track again.</p>

<p>The fugitive now made a fortunate discovery. Several
feet below the surface of the water the base of
each pillar projected far enough for standing room.
This base had probably marked the height to which
the water was originally allowed to rise. By standing
upon one of these projections, he was able to move
round the pillar, so as to keep its huge block between
himself and his pursuers. Thus they passed him. By
the light in the boat he could discern the ground or
shore near which was the entrance.</p>

<p>Returning to coast the other side of the cavern, they
had passed close by him, when, his foot slipping, he
was projected into the water. The wretches hailed
with grim joy the splash, and turned the boat in the
direction of the noise. But, dropping beneath the
surface, the man swam to a pillar near by, from which
he watched their baffled circuit of his former retreat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<p>This chase could not be kept up endlessly. Plunging
again under the water, he swam directly to the
boat. Rising suddenly, he grasped its side with main
weight and overturned it. The cries of the men and
the splashing of the boat echoed a hundred times
among the arches; while the hissing oil of the open
lamp, which, poured on the surface of the water, blazed
for a moment, made as near a representation of pandemonium
as this world ever affords, except in the
brain of the demented.</p>

<p>Though the captive had endeavored to keep his
bearings, and had not lost for an instant his presence
of mind, the swirling of the boat had destroyed all
impression of the direction he should take. He remembered
that on one of the pillars the projecting base
was broken. It was that on which he had stood when
he caught a glimpse of the ground near the entrance.
If he could find that pillar again he could take his
bearings as readily as if a star guided him. Several
pillars were tried before the talismanic one was discovered.
Feeling the broken place, and recalling the
way in which he stood upon the narrow ledge when
he saw the entrance, he took his course accordingly,
and swam on.</p>

<p>One of his pursuers had evidently found a lodgment
somewhere, and was calling lustily to his comrade for
help. But there came back no answer to his call.</p>

<p>On went the swimmer until the light of the outer
world gleamed through the crevice of the door, twenty
or thirty feet above him, and he crawled upon the
ground.</p>

<p>Squeezing the water from his garments, he climbed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
the stairway, and, opening the heavy and worm-eaten
doors, peered out. The street was crowded with
passers; for another day had come since his entrance
to the old reservoir. In his half naked and bedrabbled
condition he hesitated to make his exit, and
returned to the bottom of the stairs. A hand on the
door above made him leap to one side.</p>

<p>Giovan entered. Peering intensely into the shadows,
he descended the steps. Pausing a moment he whistled
through his teeth. There was no response. He whistled
louder on his fingers. A shout came back.</p>

<p>"Help! Giovan&mdash;help!"</p>

<p>Giovan's dagger protruded from his belt. Another's
hand suddenly drew it, and, before he had recovered
from his surprise, it entered his neck to the haft. The
Italian's short breeches, velveteen jacket and skull cap
were made to take the place of the remnant of the prisoner's
once most reputable wardrobe, and he sallied
forth.</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXXV.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ater in the day the gate keeper at Phranza's
mansion put into Morsinia's hand a letter left
with him by an Italian laboring man. It was addressed&mdash;"To
the Albanian lady," and read thus:</p>

<p>"Your brother's life is threatened by some secret
enemy. Let him exercise an Albanian's caution!
This is the advice of a stranger."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>

<p>A little before this, as the "poor Italian" was
moving away from the gate of Phranza, a gorgeous
palanquin, with silken canopy and sides latticed with
silver rods, was borne in by four stout and well-formed
men, with bare legs and arms, purple short trousers,
embroidered jackets, and jaunty red caps, whose long
tassels hung far down their backs.</p>

<p>The "Italian" stepped into an angle that the palanquin
might pass; and stood gazing a long time after
it had disappeared. At length, turning away, he said
to himself:</p>

<p>"Strange! It must be that my imagination has been
disturbed by the scenes of last night. But the lady
in yonder palanquin is my dream made real. The
pretty face of the child with whom I once played on
the mountains must have cut its outlines somewhere
on my brain, for I seem to see it everywhere. My
captive in the mountains of Albania had the same
features&mdash;though I saw them only under the flash of a
torch. Imagination that, surely! The girl at Sfetigrade
was similar. And now this one! The aga's
advice to beware female illusions was good. But she
may be the Albanian lady after all. Impossible!
Stupidity! Perhaps my chosen houri in paradise is
only flashing her beauty upon my soul from these fair
earthly faces, and so training me first to love her as an
ideal, that the joy of the realization may be perfect.
But, tut! tut! silly boy that I am!"</p>

<p>Whistling monotonously he turned down a
street.</p>

<p>A short, crooked-necked officer passed along. His
face at the moment was the picture of dissatisfaction.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
The "Italian" stopped him, and, with a courtesy which
belied his common apparel, addressed him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Captain Urban of the engineers, is it not?"</p>

<p>"And who are you?" was the surly, yet half
respectful, reply, as the one addressed glanced into
the other's face.</p>

<p>"One who knows that the cannon you are casting
are not heavy enough to lodge a ball against the old
tower of Galata yonder across the Golden Horn, much
less breach a fortification; and further, that all you
can cast at this rate from now until the Turks take
Byzantium would not enable you to throw ten shot an
hour."</p>

<p>"By the brass toe of St. Peter! man, I was just
saying the same thing to myself," replied Urban.</p>

<p>"And the Emperor's treasury, when he has bought
himself a wife, will not have enough left to buy saltpetre
with which to fire the guns, if he should allow
you brass enough for the casting," added the stranger.</p>

<p>"True again, my man; and the Emperor's service
in the meantime does not yield stipend enough for an
officer to live upon decently. If you were better
dressed, my prince of lazaroni, I couldn't afford to
ask you to drink with me; but this cheap shop will
shame neither your looks nor my purse. Come in."</p>

<p>"Who are you, my good fellow?" asked Urban, as
he drained a cup of mastic-flavored wine. "Were not
your voice different, and your pronunciation of Greek
rather provincial, with a slight Servian brogue, I
would take you for one of our young engineers. You
are not an Italian, spite of your garb."</p>

<p>"No," was the reply, "I was once in the employ of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
the Despot of Servia, engineer and artillery-man; but
I think of entering the service of the Sultan. He pays
finely, and gives one who loves the science of war a
chance to use his genius."</p>

<p>"For such a chance and good pay I would serve
the devil," said Urban. "The Greek emperor here
is no saint, and yet I have served him for a crust. I
am not bound to him by any tie. If you find good
quarters with the Turks, give me a hint, and I will join
you."</p>

<p>The stranger eyed him closely as he said this, and
replied in low tones&mdash;"Captain Urban, I am a Moslem;
Captain Ballaban of the Janizary corps. And
I bear you a commission from the Padishah. To seek
you is a part of my business in Constantinople. I do
not ask you to take my word for this, but if you will
accompany me, I will give you proof of my authority.
A thousand ducats I will put into your hand within an
hour, with which you may taste the Padishah's liberality
and imagine what it shall be when you accompany
me to Adrianople."</p>

<p>The two men left the wine shop together and entered
a bazaar. The stranger whispered to the merchant who
was nearly buried amid huge piles of goods of every
antique description; strange patterned tapestries, rugs
of all hues and sizes, ebony boxes inlaid with silver
and ivory, shields bossed and graven, spear-heads,
cimeters and daggers. The salesman made as low a
salâm as his crowding wares would permit, and, opening
a way through the heaps of merchandise, conducted
the visitors into an inner room.

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>o better understand the events just recited, we
must trace some scenes which had been enacted
elsewhere.</p>

<p>During the sojourn of Constantine and Morsinia in
Constantinople, the Turks had made no progress
toward the conquest of Albania. The walls of Croia,
upon which they turned their thousands of men, and
exhaustless resources of siege apparatus, served only to
display the valor and skill of the assailants, the superior
genius of Castriot, and the endurance of his bands
of patriots.</p>

<p>The haughty Sultan Amurath, broken in health,
more by the chagrin of his ill success than by exposures
or casual disease, retired to Adrianople, in company
with his son, Prince Mahomet, who was satisfied
with a few lessons in the science of military man&oelig;uvering
as taught by the dripping sword of Castriot; and
preferred to practice his acquirements upon other and
less dangerous antagonists. Prince Mahomet had
scarcely withdrawn to Magnesia in Asia Minor, and
celebrated his nuptials with the daughter of the Turkoman
Emir, when news was brought of the death of his
father.</p>

<p>The prince was hardly twenty-one years of age; but
his first act was ominous of the promptitude, self-assertion
and diligence of the whole subsequent career of
this man, whose success on the field and in the divan
made him the foremost monarch of his age.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<p>On hearing the news he turned to Captain Ballaban,
for whom the young Padishah entertained the fondest
affection, and who had accompanied him to Magnesia
in the capacity of kavass.&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall leave to you, Captain, the duty of representing
me at the burial of my royal father at Brusa, after
which meet me at Adrianople."</p>

<p>Leaping into the saddle, he cried to the company
about him, "Let those who love me, follow me!"
and spurred his Arab steed to the Hellespont.</p>

<p>The magnificent cortege of the dead Sultan moved
rapidly from the European capital of the Turks to
their ancient one in Asia Minor. The thoughts of the
attendants were more toward the new hand which
would distribute the favors or terrors of empire, than
toward the hand which was now cold.</p>

<p>Captain Ballaban was in time to join the reverent
circle which committed the royal body to its ancestral
resting place. They buried it with simple sepulchral
rites, in the open field, unshadowed by minaret or costly
mosque or memorial column; that, as the dying Padishah
had said, "the mercy and blessing of God might
come unto him by the shining of the sun and moon,
and the falling of the rain and dew of heaven upon his
grave."</p>

<p>Sultan Mahomet II. was scarcely within the seraglio
at Adrianople when Captain Ballaban reported for
duty. Passing through the outer or common court,
he entered by the second gate into the square surrounded
by the barracks of the Janizaries, who, as the
body guard of the monarch, occupied quarters abutting
on those of the Sultan.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p>Near the third gate was gathered a crowd of Janizaries,
in angry debate; for as soon as they realized that
the firm and experienced hand of Amurath was no
longer on the helm, the pride and audacity of this
corps inaugurated rebellion.</p>

<p>"The Janizaries have saved the empire, let them
enjoy it," cried one.</p>

<p>"Our swords extended the Moslem power, so will
we have extension of privilege," cried another.</p>

<p>"Why should Kalil Pasha be Grand Vizier instead
of our chief Aga? Kalil is one of the Giaour Ortachi.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>"Down with the Vizier!" rang among the barracks.</p>

<p>"A mere child is Padishah! one of no judgment
the Hunkiar!"</p>

<p>"My brothers," said Captain Ballaban. "You
know not the new Padishah. Well might Amurath
have said to him what Othman said to Orchan: 'My
son, I am dying: and I die without regret, because I
leave such a successor as thou art.' Believe me, my
brothers, if Mahomet is young, he is strong. If he is
inexperienced in the methods of government, it is
because heaven wills that he shall invent better ones."</p>

<p>"Your head is turned by the Padishah's favors,"
muttered an old guardsman.</p>

<p>"But am I not a Janizary?" cried the captain,
"and it is as a Janizary that the Padishah loves me,
as he loves us all. I once heard him say that the
white wool on a Janizary's cap was more honorable
than the horse tail on the tent spear of another.
Old Selim here can tell you that, as a child, Mahomet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
was fonder of the Janizary's mess than of the
feast in the harem."</p>

<p>"Yes," said old Selim, with voice trembling through
age, but loud with the enthusiasm excited by the
captain's appeal. "My hands taught Mahomet his
first parries and thrusts; and he would sit by our fire
to listen to the stories of the valor of our corps, and
clap his hands, and cry 'good Selim, I would rather
be a Janizary than be a prince.'" The old man's eyes
filled with tears as he added, "And all the four thousand
prophets bless the Padishah!"</p>

<p>While this scene was being enacted without, the
young Sultan was reclining, with the full sense of his
new dignity, upon the sofa which had never been
pressed except by the person of royalty. It was
covered with a cloth of gold and crimson velvet,
relieved by fringes of pearls. Before it was spread
a carpet of silk, an inch thick, whose softness, both of
texture and tints, made a luxuriant contrast with its
border, which was crocheted with cords of silver and
gold. The walls of his chamber were enriched with
tiles of alabaster, agate, and turquoise. The ceiling
was plated with beaten silver, hatched at intervals with
mouldings of gold; near to which were windows of
stained glass made of hundreds of pieces closely joined
to form transparent mosaic pictures, through which the
variegated light flooded the apartment.</p>

<p>Mahomet was himself in striking contrast with his
surroundings. He was dressed in négligé, with loose
gown, large slippers, and white skull cap.</p>

<p>Before the Sultan stood the Grand Vizier, Kalil,
bedizened in the costume of his office:&mdash;an enormous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
turban in whose twisted folds was a band of
gold; a bournous of brocade, enlivened by flowers
wrought upon it in green and red; and a cashmere
sash gleaming with the jewelled handle of his yataghan.</p>

<p>"They are even now in revolt, your Majesty," said
the Vizier. "Your safety will be best served by severe
measures. They say the iron has not grown into your
nerves yet."</p>

<p>The Sultan colored. After a moment's pause he
replied. "When Captain Ballaban comes we will
think of that matter."</p>

<p>"The captain had just arrived as I entered, Sire."</p>

<p>"Then announce to the Janizaries that the seven
thousand falconers and game keepers which my father
allowed to eat up our revenue, as the bugs infest the
trees, are abolished; and their income appropriated
to the better equipment of the Janizaries."</p>

<p>"But, Sire, would you sharpen the fangs of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence! I have said it," said Mahomet, striking
his hand on his knee. "But what is this demand
from Constantinople?"</p>

<p>"That the pay for the detention of your Cousin
Orkran at Constantinople shall be doubled, or the
Greeks will let him loose to contest the throne with
your Majesty."</p>

<p>"Assent to the demand," said the Sultan. "The
time will the sooner come to avenge the insult, if we
seem not to see it."</p>

<p>The Vizier continued looking at his tablets. "Maria
Sultana<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> asks, through the Kislar Aga, that she may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
be allowed, since the death of her lord, to return to
her kindred."</p>

<p>"Let her go! She is a Giaour whose cursed blood
was not bettered by six and twenty years' habitation
with my father. She is fair enough in her wrinkles
for some Christian prince, and George Brankovitch
needs to make new alliances."</p>

<p>"Hunyades"&mdash;said the Vizier.</p>

<p>"Ay, make peace with him, and with Scanderbeg,
too, if that wild beast can be tamed, which I much
doubt."</p>

<p>The Sultan rose from his cushion, his form animated
with strong excitement, and, putting his hand upon
the shoulders of the Vizier&mdash;who drew back at the
strange familiarity&mdash;and looking him fixedly in the
face, he whispered: "Everything must wait,"&mdash;and
the words hissed in the hot eagerness with which
he said them&mdash;"until&mdash;I have Constantinople."</p>

<p>Turning upon his heel, he withdrew toward his
private chamber.</p>

<p>The Sultan threw himself upon his bed. The Capee
Aga, or chief of the white eunuchs, whose duty it was
to act as valet-de-chambre, as well as to stand at the
right hand of the Sultan on state occasions, began to
draw the curtains around the silver posts upon which
the bed rested.</p>

<p>"You may leave me," said his majesty. "Nay,
hold! Send Captain Ballaban of the Janizaries."</p>

<p>As the young officer entered, the face of the Sultan
relaxed.</p>

<p>"You make me a man again, comrade," said he,
grasping his hand. "These few days playing Sultan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
make me feel as old as the empire. I hate this parade
of boring viziers and mincing eunuchs; and to
be shut up here with these palace proprieties is as irksome
to me as Timour's iron cage was to my grandfather
Bajazet. I think I shall put my harem on horse-back,
and take to the fields. Scudding out of Albania
with Scanderbeg at one's heels were preferable to
this busy idleness. You have had a rapid ride to get
from Brusa so soon, and look winded. Roll yourself
on that wolf's skin. I killed that fellow in
Caramania. By the turban of Abraham! your red
head looks well against the black hide. But why
don't you laugh? Have they made a Padishah of you,
too, that you must mask your face with care?"</p>

<p>"I have a care, Sire," said the soldier.</p>

<p>"Tell me it," said the Sultan, "and I'll make it fly
away as fast as the Prophet's horse took him to the
seventh heaven."</p>

<p>"The Janizaries are restless, Sire."</p>

<p>"Does not the donative I have announced pacify
them?"</p>

<p>"I have not heard of it," said the officer.</p>

<p>"Listen! Is not that their shout?" Shout after
shout rent the air from the court without.</p>

<p>The Janizary turned pale; but in a moment said,
"Your donative has been announced. They are
cheering your Majesty."</p>

<p>"Long live the Padishah!" "Long life to Mahomet!"
rang again and again.</p>

<p>"I thank you, Sire," eagerly cried the young man,
kissing the hand of the Sultan.</p>

<p>"What else would they have?" asked he.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing but chance to show their gratitude by valiant
service," was the reply.</p>

<p>"This they shall have, with you to lead them,"
putting his hand on the young officer's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Nay, Sire, I may not supplant those who are my
superiors by virtue of service already rendered."</p>

<p>"But I command it. The corps shall to-morrow
be put under your orders as their chief Aga."</p>

<p>"I beg your Majesty to desist from this purpose,"
said Ballaban. "The spirit of the corps, its efficiency,
depends upon the strictest observance of the ancient
rules of Orchan and Aladdin. By them we have been
made what we are."</p>

<p>"But," cried Mahomet angrily, "there shall be
no other will than mine throughout the army."</p>

<p>"I would have no other will than thine, Sire," was
the response; "but it were well if your will should be
to leave the Janizaries' rule untouched."</p>

<p>"You young rebel!" cried Mahomet, half vexed yet
half pleased as, bursting into a laugh, he dashed over
the face of his friend a jar of iced sherbet which was
upon a lacquered stand at his side.</p>

<p>"You may thank the devil that it wasn't the arrow
I once shot you with," said the playful tyrant, as Ballaban
jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>"If you were not the Sultan now, I would pull
you from the bed, as I pulled you from your horse
that day," replied the good-natured favorite, making a
motion as if to execute the threat.</p>

<p>"You are right," said Mahomet rising. "I am Sultan!
Sultan? pshaw! Yet Sultan, surely." He paced
the floor in deep agitation, and at length said, "I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
have a duty to perform, than which I would rather cut
off my arms."</p>

<p>"Let me do the deed, though it takes my arm and
my life," said Ballaban eagerly.</p>

<p>"You know not what it is, my old comrade."</p>

<p>"But I pledge before I know," was the response
which came from stiffened lips and bowed head, as
the captain made his obeisance.</p>

<p>The Sultan looked him in the face long and earnestly,
and then, turning away, said:</p>

<p>"No! no! there are hands less noble than yours."</p>

<p>"But try me, Sire."</p>

<p>"You know the custom of our ancestors, approved
by the wisdom of divans, as an expedient essential to
the peace and safety of the empire, that&mdash;But I can not
speak it: nor will I ask it of you. Leave me, Captain.
Come to-morrow at this hour. I shall need the relief
of your company then, even more than to-day."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>n hour later the Kislar Aga, chief of the black
eunuchs in charge of the royal harem, was
announced.</p>

<p>"Well, Sinam, have any of your herd of gazelles
escaped?" asked the Sultan.</p>

<p>"None. But Mira Sultana would pay her homage
at your Majesty's feet."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span></p>

<p>"Mira, the Greek?" said Mahomet, the deep color
rising to his temples.</p>

<p>Lowering his tone to a whisper, he conversed for a
few moments with the eunuch, who prostrated himself
upon the ground, and with harsh, yet thin voice, said:</p>

<p>"Your Majesty is wise, very wise. Your will is that
of Allah, the Great Hunkiar. It shall be done."</p>

<p>Mira was a beautiful woman. The light texture of
her robe revealed a perfect form; and the thin veil
lent a charm to her face, such as shadows send across
the landscape.</p>

<p>Mahomet shuddered, as the kneeling woman
embraced his feet. The words of her congratulation
to the young monarch, her protestation of devotion to
him as to his father, though uttered with the sweetest
voice he had ever heard, and with evident honesty,
sent a visible tremor through the frame of her listener.
And when she added, "My child, Ahmed, the image
of his noble father and thine, will serve thee with his
life, and"&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is well! It is well," interrupted the Sultan.
"Be gone now!"</p>

<p>The morning following was one in which the hearts
of the citizens of Adrianople stood almost throbless
with horror. Mothers clasped their babes with a shudder
to their breasts; and fathers stroked the fair hair
of their boys, and thanked Allah that no tide of royal
blood ran in their veins. A story afterward floated
over the lands of Moslem and Christian, as terrible as
a cloud of blood, dropping its shadow into palace and
cottage, and dyeing that page of history on which
Mahomet's name is written with a damning blot.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span></p>

<p>While Mira Sultana was bowing at the feet of the
new monarch, congratulating him upon his accession
to the throne, her infant son, Ahmed, half brother to
Mahomet, was being strangled in the bath by his
orders. Another son of Amurath, Calapin, had,
through his mother's timely suspicion, escaped to the
land of the Christians.</p>

<p>It was late in the day when Captain Ballaban
appeared for audience with the Sultan. His Majesty
was apparently in the gayest of moods.</p>

<p>"Come, toss me the dice! We have not played
since I laid aside my manhood and put on the Padishah's
cloak. Come! What? Have you no stake to
put up? Then I will stake for both. A Turkoman,
the father of my own bride, has sent me a bevy of
women, Georgians, with faces as fair as the shell of an
ostrich's egg,<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and voices as sweet as of the birds which
sang to the harp of David.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The choice to him who
wins! What! does not that tempt the cloud to
drift off your face? Then have your choice without
the toss. What! still brooding?" added he, growing
angry. "By the holy house at Mecca! I'll make
you laugh if I tickle your ribs with my dagger's point."</p>

<p>"You made me promise that I would be true to
you, my Padishah, and if I should laugh to-day I
would not be true," replied Ballaban quietly. "My
face wears the shadows which the people have thrown
into it."</p>

<p>"The people?" said Mahomet growing pale.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay, the people have heard the wailing of the
Sultana."</p>

<p>"For what? Tell me for what?" asked the Sultan
with feigned surprise.</p>

<p>Ballaban narrated the story which was on every
one's lips.</p>

<p>"It is treason against me," cried the monarch.
Summoning the Capee Aga he bade him call the
divan.</p>

<p>The great personages of the empire were speedily
gathered in the audience room. At the right of the
Sultan stood the Grand Vizier and three subordinate
viziers. On his left was the Kadiasker, the chief of
the judges, with other members of the ulema or guild
of lawyers, constituting the high court. The Reis-Effendi,
or clerk, stood with his tablets before the
seat of the Sultan. The rear of the room was filled
with various princes and high officials.</p>

<p>Turning to the Kadiasker, the Sultan asked:</p>

<p>"What is the denomination of the crime, and the
penalty of him who, unbidden by the Padishah, shall
put to death a child of royal blood?"</p>

<p>The Kadiasker, after a moment's evident surprise
at the question, pronounced slowly the following
decision:</p>

<p>"It were a double crime, Sire, being both murder
and treason. And if perchance the child were fatherless,
let a triple curse come upon the slayer. For
what saith the Book of the Prophet?<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> 'They who
devour the possessions of orphans unjustly, shall
swallow down nothing but fire into their bellies, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
shall broil in raging flames.' If such be the curse
of Allah upon him who shall despoil the child of his
rightful goods, much more does Allah bid us visit
with vengeance one who despoils the child of that
chiefest possession&mdash;his life. Such is the law, O Zil
Ullah."<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Turning to the Kislar Aga, Mahomet commanded
him to give testimony.</p>

<p>The Nubian trembled as he looked into the blanched
face of the Sultan; but soon recovered his self possession
sufficiently to read his master's thoughts, and
said,</p>

<p>"The child of Mira Sultana was found dead at the
bath while in the hands of Sayid."</p>

<p>"Was Sayid the child's appointed attendant?"
asked the Kadiasker.</p>

<p>"He was not," was the response.</p>

<p>"Let him die!" said the judge slowly.</p>

<p>"Let him die!" repeated the Grand Vizier.</p>

<p>The Sultan bowed in assent and withdrew.</p>

<p>The swift vengeance of the Padishah was hailed
with applause by the officials, as if it had erased the
blood guilt from the robe of royal honor; but the people
shook their heads, and kept shadows on their faces
for many days.</p>

<p>"I tire of this life in the barracks," said Captain
Ballaban to the Sultan, shortly after this event.</p>

<p>"Speak honestly, man," was the reply. "You tire
of me; my heart is not large enough to entertain one
of such ambition."</p>

<p>"Nay, Sire, but I would get nearer to the innermost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
core of your heart, into that which is your deepest
desire."</p>

<p>"And where, think you, is that spot?" said the Sultan
smiling.</p>

<p>"Constantinople," was the laconic response.</p>

<p>"Ah! true lover of mine art thou, if you would be
there. Until I put the Mihrab<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> in the walls of St.
Sophia, I shall not sleep without the dream that I
have done it. Know you not the dream of Othman?
how the leaves of the tree which sprang from his
bosom when the fair Malkhatoon, the mother of all the
Padishahs, sank upon it, were shaped like cimeters,
and every wind turned their points toward Constantinople?
My waking and sleeping thoughts are the
leaves. The spirit of Othman breathes through my
soul and turns them thither. Go! and prepare my
coming. The walls withstood my father Amurath.
Discover why? I hear that Urban, the cannon founder,
is in the pay of the Greeks. He who discovered a
way to turn the Dibrians against Sfetigrade can find a
way to turn a foreigner's eyes from the battered crown
of the Cæsars to something brighter&mdash;Go, and Allah
give you wisdom!"</p>

<p>The reader is acquainted with the immediate sequel
of Captain Ballaban's departure, his adventure with
the Italian desperadoes at the old reservoir, and his
success with Urban.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he siege and capture of Constantinople by the
Turks in 1453, was, with the exception of the
discovery of America, the most significant event of
the fifteenth century. The Eastern Roman Empire
then perished, after eleven centuries of glory and
shame; of heroic conquests, and pusillanimous compromises
with other powers for the privilege of existence;
exhibiting on its throne the virtues and wisdom
of Theodosius and Justinian, and the vices and
follies of emperors and empresses whose names it were
well that the world should forget.</p>

<p>But the historic importance of the siege was matched
by the thrilling interest which attaches to its scenes.</p>

<p>The last of the Constantines, from whose hands the
queenly city was wrested, was worthy the name borne
by its great founder, not, perhaps, for his display of
genius in government and command, but for the pious
devotion and sacrificial courage with which he defended
his trust. A band of less than ten thousand Christians,
mostly Greeks, and a few Latins whose love for the
essential truth of their religion was stronger than their
bigotry for sect, withstood for many weeks the horrors
which were poured upon them by a quarter of a
million Moslems. These foes were made presumptuous
by nearly a century of unchecked conquest; their
hot blood boiled with fury and daring excited by the
promises of their religion, which opened paradise to
those that perished with the sword; and they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
led by the first flashings of the startling genius and
audacity of Mahomet II.</p>

<p>The Bosphorus was blockaded six miles above the
city by the new fortress, Rumili-Hissar, the Castle of
Europe; answering across the narrow strait to
Anadolu-Hissari&mdash;the Castles of Asia.</p>

<p>A fleet of three hundred Moslem vessels crowded
the entrance to the Bosphorus, to resist any Western
ally of the Christians that might have run the gauntlet
of forts which guarded the lower entrance to Marmora.
At the same time this naval force threatened
the long water front of the city with overwhelming
assault. The wall which lay between the sea of
Marmora and the Golden Horn, and made the city a
triangle, looked down upon armies gathered from the
many lands between the Euphrates and Danube;&mdash;the
feudal chivalry from their ziamets under magnificently
accoutred beys; the terrible Akindji, the
mounted scourge of the borders of Christendom; the
motley hordes of Azabs, light irregular foot-soldiers,&mdash;these
filling the plains for miles away:&mdash;while about
the tents of the Sultan were the Royal Horse Guards,
the Spahis, Salihdars, Ouloufedji and Ghoureba,
rivals for the applause of the nations, as the most
daring of riders and most skilful of swordsmen: and
the Janizaries, who boasted that their tread was as
resistless as the waves of an earthquake.</p>

<p>Miners from Servia were ready to burrow beneath
the walls. A great cannon cast by Urban, the Dacian,
who had deserted from the Christian to the Moslem
camp, gaped ready to hurl its stone balls of six hundred
pounds weight. It was flanked by two almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
equally enormous fire-vomiting dragons, as the new
artillery was called: while fourteen other batteries of
lesser ordnance were waiting to pour their still novel
destruction upon the works. Ancient art blended with
modern science in the attack; for battering rams supplemented
cannon, and trenches breast-deep completed
the lines of shields. Moving forts of wood antagonized,
across the deep moat, the old stone towers, which
during the centuries had hurled back their assailants
in more than twenty sieges. The various hosts of
besiegers in their daily movements were like the folds
of an enormous serpent, writhing in ever contracting
circles about the body of some helpless prey. From
dawn to dark the walls crumbled beneath the pounding
of the artillery; but from dark to dawn they rose
again under the toil of the sleepless defenders.</p>

<p>Thousands, impelled by the commands of the Sultan,
and more, perhaps, by the prospect of reward in
this world, and in another, out of which bright-eyed
houris were watching their prospective lords, mounted
the scaling ladders only to fill with their bodies the
moat beneath. At the point of greatest danger the
besieged were inspired with the courage of their
Emperor, and by the aid of the bands of Italians whom
the purse and the appeals of John Giustiniani had
brought as the last offering of the common faith of
Christendom upon the great altar already dripping
with a nation's blood.</p>

<p>Sometimes when the Christians, whose fewness
compared with the assailants compelled them to serve
both day and night, were discouraged by incessant
danger and fatigue, a light form in helmet and breastplate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
moved among them, regardless of arrows and
bullets of lead: now stooping to staunch the wounds
of the fallen; now mounting the parapet, where scores
of stout soldiers shielded her with their bodies, and
hailed her presence with the shout of "The Albanian!
The Albanian!" The reverence which the soldiers
gave to the devoted nuns, who were incessant in their
ministry of mercy, was surpassed by that with which
they regarded Morsinia. She had become in their
eyes the impersonation of the cause for which they
were struggling.</p>

<p>The interruption by the war of the negotiations
with the Emir of Trebizond, whose daughter had been
selected as the imperial spouse, revived the rumors
which had once associated the fair Albanian's name
with that of his Majesty; and gave rise to a nick-name,
"the Little Empress," which, among the soldiers,
came to be spoken with almost as much loyalty of
personal devotion, as if it had received the imperial
sanction.</p>

<p>Constantine's solicitude led him to remonstrate with
Morsinia for the exposure of her person to the dangers
of the wall: but she replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you not said, my dear brother, that the
defence is hopeless? that the city must fall? What
fate then awaits me? The Turks have service for men
whom they capture, which, though hard, is not damning
to body and soul. What if they send you to the
mines, to the galleys? What if they slay you? You
can endure that. Yet I know that you yourself would
perish in the fight before you would submit to even
such a fate. But what is the destiny of a woman who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
shall fall into their hands? It is better to die than to
be taken captive. And is not yonder breach where the
men of the true God are giving their lives for their
faith, as sacred as was ever an altar on earth? Is not
the crown of martyrdom better than a living death in
the harem of the infidel? The arrow that finds me
there on the wall shall be to me as an angel from heaven;
and a death-wound received there will be as painless
to my soul as the kiss of God."</p>

<p>"But this must not be!" cried Constantine. "Our
valor, if it does not save the city, may lead to surrender
upon terms which shall save all the lives of the
people."</p>

<p>"It is impossible," replied she. "His Majesty
informed me yesterday that Mahomet had pledged to
his soldiers the spoil of the city, with unlimited license
to pillage."</p>

<p>Constantine was silent, but at length added. "If
worst comes, it will then be time enough to expose
your life."</p>

<p>"But the end is near, dear Constantine. The city
is badly provisioned. The poor are already starving.
The garrison is on allowance which can sustain it but
a few days. Besides, as you have told me, the Italians
are at feud with the Greeks, and ready to open
the gates if famine presses upon them."</p>

<p>"Yes, curses on the head of that monk Gennadius,
who sends insult to our allies every day from his cell!"
muttered Constantine. "But I cannot see you in danger,
Morsinia. Promise me&mdash;for your life is dearer
to me than my own&mdash;that you will not go upon the
walls. I need not the solemn oath to our brave Castriot,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
and that to our father Kabilovitsch, that I will
guard you. But, if not for my sake, then for their
sake, take my counsel. I know that you are under the
special care of the Blessed Jesu. Has He not shielded
us both&mdash;me for your sake&mdash;many times before?"</p>

<p>"Your words are wise, my brother. You need not
urge the will of Castriot and father Kabilovitsch, for
your own wish is to me as sacred as that of any one on
earth," said she, looking him in the eyes with the reverence
of affection, and yielding to his embrace as he
kissed her forehead.</p>

<p>"But," added she, "I must exact of you one promise."</p>

<p>"Any thing, my darling, that is consistent with your
safety," was the quick reply.</p>

<p>"It is this. Promise me, by the Virgin Mother of
God, that you will not allow me to become a living
captive to the Turk."</p>

<p>"Not if my life can shield you. This you know!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I would not ask that, but something harder
than that you should die for me."</p>

<p>A pallor spread over the face of Constantine, for he
suspected her meaning, yet asked, "And what&mdash;what
may that be?"</p>

<p>"Take my life with your own hand, rather than that
a Turk should touch me," said Morsinia, without the
slightest tremor in her voice.</p>

<p>Constantine stood aghast. Morsinia continued, taking
his strong right hand in hers, and raising it to her
lips&mdash;</p>

<p>"That were joy, indeed, if the hand of him who
loves me, the hand which has saved me from danger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
so often&mdash;could redeem me from this which I fear
more than a thousand deaths! Promise me for love's
sake!"</p>

<p>"I may not promise such a thing," said the young
lover, with a voice which showed that her request
had cut him to the heart.</p>

<p>"Then you love me not," said the girl, turning
away.</p>

<p>But the look upon Constantine's face showed the
terrible tragedy which was in his soul, and that such
an accusation brought it too near its culmination.
Instantly she threw herself into his arms.</p>

<p>"Forgive me! forgive me!" cried she. "I will
not impugn that love which has proved itself too
often. But let us speak calmly of it. Why should
you shrink from this?" she asked, leading him to a
seat beside her.</p>

<p>"Because I love you. My hand would become
paralyzed sooner than touch rudely a hair of your
head."</p>

<p>"Nay, in that you do not know yourself," said
Morsinia. "Would you not pluck a mole from my
face if I was marred by it in your eyes!"</p>

<p>"But that would be to perfect, not to harm you,"
said Constantine.</p>

<p>"And did you not hold the hand of the poor soldier
to-day, while the leech was cutting him, lest the
gangrene should infect his whole body with poison?
And would you not have done so had he been your
long lost brother, Michael, whom you loved? And
would you not have done it more willingly because
you loved him?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Constantine, "but that would be to
save life, not to destroy it."</p>

<p>"But what, my brother dear, is the fairness of a
face compared with the fairness of honor? What the
breath of the body, when both the body and the soul
in it are threatened with contamination of such
an existence as every woman receives from the
Turk?"</p>

<p>"I cannot argue with you, Morsinia. My nature
rebels against the deed you propose."</p>

<p>"But," replied she, "is not love nobler, and should
it not be stronger, than nature? If nature should
rebel against love, let love crush the rebellion, and
show its sovereignty. If my hand should tremble to
do aught that your true service required, I would
accuse my hand of lack of devotion. But I think
that men do not know the fulness of love as women
do."</p>

<p>"Let me ask the question of you, Morsinia," replied
the young lover after a pause. "Could you take my
life as I lie here? Will your hand mix the poison to
put to my lips in the event of the Turk entering the
city? My life will be worse than death in its bitterness
if you are lost to me."</p>

<p>Morsinia pondered the question, growing pale
with the fearfulness of the thought. For a while she
was speechless. The imagination started by Constantine's
question seemed to stun her. She stared at
the vague distance. At length she burst into tears,
and laying her head upon her companion's shoulder,
said:</p>

<p>"I love you too dearly, Constantine, to ask that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
you which you shrink from doing. There is another
who can render me the service."</p>

<p>"Who would dare?" said Constantine, rising and
gazing wildly at her. "Who would dare to touch you,
even at your own bidding?"</p>

<p>"I would," said Morsinia quietly. "And this I shall
save for the moment when I need the last friend on
earth," she added, drawing from her dress the bright
blade of an Italian stiletto. "Perhaps, my heart would
tremble, and my flesh shrink from the sharp point,
though I love not myself as I love you."</p>

<p>"Let us talk no more of this," said Constantine,
"but leave it for the hour of necessity, which happily
I think will not soon come. I must tell you now for
what I sought you. I have been ordered this very
night to aid in a venture which, heaven grant! shall
re-provision the city. Several large galleys, laden with
corn and oil, are now coming up the sea from Genoa.
If they see the cordon of the enemy's ships drawn
across the harbor, not knowing the extremity to which
the city is reduced, they may return without venturing
an encounter. I am to reach them, and, if possible,
induce them to cut their way through. The great
chain at the entrance to the Golden Horn will be lowered
at the opportune moment, and all the shipping
in the harbor will make an attack upon the enemy's
fleet. Of this our allies must be informed. As soon
as it is dark I shall drift in a swift little skiff between
these Turkish boats; and before the dawn I shall
be far down on Marmora. To-morrow night, if
your prayers are offered, Jesu will grant us success."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span></p>

<p>With a kiss he released himself from her embrace
and was gone.</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>onstantine eluded the heavy boats of the
Turks, which were anchored to prevent their drifting
away upon the swift current with which the Black
Sea discharges itself through the Bosphorus into Marmora.
Upon meeting the befriending galleys, it was with
little difficulty that he persuaded the Genoese captains
to risk the encounter with the Turkish fleet. As Constantine
pointed out to the Italian captains, the enormous
navy of the blockaders, formed in the shape of
a crescent, and stretched from the wall of the city
across to the Asiatic shore, presented a more formidable
obstacle to the eye than to the swift and skilfully
manned Genoese galleys. The Turkish boats were
generally but small craft, and laden down to the water's
edge with men. The Genoese had four galleys,
together with one which belonged to Byzantium.</p>

<p>These were vessels of the largest size, constructed
by men who had learned to assert their prowess as
lords of the sea. They were armed with cannon
adapted to sweep the deck of an adversary at short
range:&mdash;a weapon which the Turks had not yet floated,
though they were in advance of the Christians in using
such artillery on land. The high sides of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
Christian galleys, moreover, prevented their being
boarded except with dangerous climbing, while the
defenders stood ready to pour the famous liquid called
"Greek fire" upon the heads of those who should
attempt it. Besides, heaven favored the Christians;
for a strong gale was blowing, which, while it tossed the
boats of their adversaries beyond their easy control,
filled the sails of the Genoese, and sent them bounding
over the waves: the oarsmen sitting ready to catch
deftly into the bending billows with their blades.
Each of the five vessels chose for a target a large one
of the Turks, and clove it with its iron prow: while
the cannon swept the Turkish soldiers by hundreds
from other boats near to them. Passing through the
thin crescent, the Christian galleys skilfully tacked, and,
careening upon their sides, again assailed the Turks before
they could evade their swift and resistless momentum.
Again and again the galleys passed, like shuttles
on a loom, through the line of the enemy, sinking
the unwieldy hulks and drowning the crowded crews.</p>

<p>From the walls and house tops of the city went up
huzzas for the victors and praises to heaven. From
the shores of Asia, and from below the city wall, thousands
of Moslems groaned their imprecations. The
Sultan raged upon the beach, as he saw one after another
of his pennants sink beneath the waves. Dashing
far into the sea upon his horse, he vented his impotent
fury in beating the water with his mace, shrieking
maledictions into the laughing winds, and invoking
upon the Christians curses from all the Pagan gods
and Moslem saints.</p>

<p>At one moment the Byzantine galley was nearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
overcome, having been caught in a group of Turkish
boats, whose occupants climbed her sides, and did
murderous work among the crew. Though ultimately
rescued by the Genoese, it was only after severe loss.</p>

<p>But above all other casualties the Christians
mourned the fate of young Constantine. With almost
superhuman strength he had cut down several assailants;
but was finally set upon by such odds that he
was pressed over the low bulwarks, and fell into the
sea. The galley with its consorts made way to the
chain at the entrance to the Golden Horn, where the
rich stores, a thousand times richer now in the
necessity which they relieved, were received amid the
acclamations of the grateful Greeks.</p>

<p>But woe,&mdash;Oh, so heavy! crushed one solitary
heart. Her eyes stared wildly at the messenger who
brought the fatal tidings; and stared, hour by
hour, in their stony grief, upon the wall of her
apartment. Kind attendants spoke to her, but she
heard them not. Her soul seemed to have gone
seeking in other worlds the soul of her lover. The
servants, awed by the majesty of her sorrow, sat
down in the court without, and waited: but she called
them not. Daylight faded into darkness. The lamp
which was brought she waved with her hand to have
taken away. The maidens who came to disrobe her
for the night found her bowed with her face upon the
couch; and, receiving no response to their proffered
offices, retired again to wait.</p>

<p>The morning came; and the cheer of the sunlight
which, quickening the outer world, poured through
the windows high in the walls of her apartment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
seemed to awaken her from her trance. But how
changed in appearance! The ruddy hue of health,
and the bronzing of daily exposure to the open air,
seemed alike to have been blanched by that which had
taken hope from her soul. Her eyes were sunken,
and the lustre in them, though not lessened, now
seemed to come from an infinite depth&mdash;from some
distant, inner world which had lost all relation to this,
as a passing star. Morsinia rose, weak at first; but
her limbs grew strong with the imparted strength of
her will. She ate; and speaking aloud&mdash;but more in
addressing herself than her attendants&mdash;said: "I will
away to the walls!"</p>

<p>Through the masses of debris, and among the
groups of men who were resting and waiting to take
the places of their wearied comrades on the ramparts,
she went straight to the gate of St. Romanus, where
the assaults were most incessant. The cry of "The
Little Empress!" gave way to that of "The Panurgia!
The Panurgia!"<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> as some, though familiar with
her form, were startled by the almost unearthly change
of her countenance. She returned no salutation as was
usual with her, but, as if impelled by some superhuman
purpose, her beauty lit as with a halo by the
majesty of a celestial passion, she climbed the steps
into the tottering tower above the gate. A strong,
but gentle hand was put upon her arm. It was that
of the Emperor.</p>

<p>"My daughter, you must not be here. Come away!"</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span></p>

<p>She looked at him for an instant in hesitation; and
then, bowing her head, responded in scarcely audible
voice:</p>

<p>"I will obey you, Sire," and added, speaking to
herself&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is <i>his</i> will too."</p>

<p>"I know your grief," said his majesty kindly,
"and now, as your Emperor, I must protect you
against yourself."</p>

<p>"I want no protection," cried the broken-hearted
girl. "Oh, let me die! For what should I live?"</p>

<p>"My dear child," said the Emperor with trembling
voice, while the tears filled his eyes. "In other days
your holy faith taught me how to be strong. Now, in
your necessity, let me repeat to you the lesson. For
what shall <i>you</i> live? For what should <i>I</i> live? I am
Emperor, but my empire is doomed. I live no longer
for earthly hope, but solely to do duty; nothing but
duty, stern duty, painful every instant, crushing
always, but a burden heaven imposed on a breaking
heart. That heaven appoints it&mdash;that, and that alone&mdash;makes
me willing to live and do it. When the time
comes I shall seek death where the slain lie the
thickest. But not to-day; for to-day I can serve.
Live for duty! Live for God! The days may not be
many before we shall clasp hands with those who,
now invisible, are looking upon us. Let us go and
cheer the living before we seek the companionship of
the dead."</p>

<p>As the Emperor spoke, his face glowed with a
majesty of soul which made the symbol of earthly majesty
that adorned his brow seem poor indeed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span></p>

<p>Gazing a moment with reverent amazement at the
man who had already received the divine anointing
for the sacrifice of martyrdom he was so soon to offer,
Morsinia responded:</p>

<p>"Your words, Sire, come to me as from the lips of
God. I will go and pray, and then&mdash;then I shall live
for duty."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XL.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>ahomet had not expended all his petulant rage
upon feelingless waves and distant Christians.
He summoned to his presence the Admiral of his
defeated fleet, Baltaoghli, and ordered that he should
be impaled.</p>

<p>The Admiral had shown as much naval skill as could,
perhaps, have been exhibited with the unwieldy boats
at his command; and, moreover, had brought from
the fight an eyeless socket to attest his bravery and
devotion. The penalty, therefore, which Mahomet
attached to his misfortune, brought cries of entreaty
in his behalf from other brave officers, especially from
the leading Janizaries. This opposition at first confirmed
the determination of the irate despot. But
soon the petition of the honored corps swelled into a
murmur, which the more experienced of his advisers
persuaded Mahomet to heed.</p>

<p>The Sultan had schooled himself to obey the precept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
which Yusef, the eunuch, who instructed his childhood,
had imparted, viz, "Make passion bend to policy."
He therefore apparently yielded, so far at least as to
compromise with those whom he feared to offend, and
commuted the Admiral's sentence to a flogging.</p>

<p>The brave man was stretched upon the ground by
four slaves. Turning to Captain Ballaban, the Sultan
bade him lay on the lash. Ballaban hesitated. Drawing
near to Mahomet, he said respectfully, but firmly,</p>

<p>"The Janizaries are soldiers, not executioners, Sire."</p>

<p>Mahomet's rage burst as suddenly as powder under
the spark.</p>

<p>"Away with the rebel!" cried he. "We will find
the executioner for him, too, who dares to disobey our
orders."</p>

<p>Seizing his golden mace, the Sultan himself beat the
prostrate form of the Admiral until it was senseless.</p>

<p>Wearying of his bloody work, Mahomet glared like a
half satiated beast upon those about him.</p>

<p>"Where is the damned rebel who dares dispute my
will? Did no one arrest him?"</p>

<p>"The order was not so understood," said an Aga
who was near.</p>

<p>"You understand it now," growled the infuriated,
yet half-ashamed, monarch. "Arrest him!&mdash;But no!
Let these slaves go search for the runaway. It shall
be their office to deal with one who dares to break
with my will."</p>

<p>The Janizaries returned to their places near the
walls.</p>

<p>Mahomet was ill at ease when his better judgment
displaced his unwise passion. His love for Ballaban,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
the manliness of the captain's reply to the unreasonable
order, and the danger of injuring one who stood
so high in the estimate of the entire Janizary corps,
were not outweighed even by the sense of the indignity
which the act of disobedience had put upon the
royal authority.</p>

<p>The slaves, not daring to venture among the Janizaries
in their search for Captain Ballaban, easily persuaded
themselves that he must have fled; and that,
perhaps, he might be lurking somewhere on the shore,
as this was the only way of escape. Their search was
rewarded. Though in the disguise of scant garments,
utterly exhausted so that he could make no resistance,
their victim was readily recognized by his form and
features, which were too peculiar to be mistaken.
The captain had apparently attempted to escape by
water; perhaps, had ventured upon some chance
kaik or raft, and been wrecked in the caldron which
the strong south wind made with the current pouring
from the north.</p>

<p>His wet garments, such as he had not stripped off,
and his exhausted look confirmed their theory.</p>

<p>One of their number brought the report to the Grand
Vizier, Kalil, who repeated it to the Sultan.</p>

<p>"I will deal with him in person. Let no one know
of the capture until I have seen him," said Mahomet,
seeking an opportunity to revoke the threat against
his friend, which he had uttered in insane rage; and,
at the same time, to cover his imperial dignity by the
semblance of a trial.</p>

<p>The culprit was brought in the early evening to the
Sultan's tent. A large lantern of various colored crystals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
hung from the ridge-pole, and threw its beautiful,
but partly obscured, light over the arraigned
man.</p>

<p>His captors had clothed him in the uniform of the
Janizaries.</p>

<p>"His face has a strange look, as if another's soul
had taken lodging behind the familiar lineaments,"
the Sultan remarked to Kalil as he scanned the culprit
closely.</p>

<p>"Do you know, knave, in whose presence you
are?" said Mahomet, sternly.</p>

<p>"I know not, Sire, except that the excellent adornment
of your person and pavilion suggest that I am
in the presence of his majesty the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence, villain! do you mock me?" cried the
Padishah, in surprise at the man's assumed ignorance.</p>

<p>"I mock thee not, Sire," said the victim, bowing with
courtly reverence, and speaking in a sort of patois of
Greek and Turkish. "But I was about to say that I
know thee not, except that from the excellence of thy
person and estate thou art none less"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Silence, you dog! This is no time for your familiar
jesting, Ballaban. Speak pure tongue, or I'll
cut thine from thy head!" interrupted the Padishah.</p>

<p>"I speak as best I can," replied the man, "for I
was not brought up to the Turkish tongue. I presume
that I address the king of the Turks."</p>

<p>"Miserable wretch!" hissed his majesty, drawing
his jewelled sword. "Dare you call me king of the
<i>Turks</i>? <span class="smcap">Turks</span>! thou circumcised Christian dog! thou
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
pup of Nazarene parentage! thou damned infidel,
beplastered with Moslem favors!"<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>"It would seem that I needed Moslem favors, which
in my destitute condition and imminent danger, I
most humbly crave," replied the object of this
contumely.</p>

<p>"Are you mad?" shrieked the Sultan, rising and
glaring into the other's face. "You <i>are</i> mad, man.
Poor soul! Ay! Ay! I see it now. Some demon has
possessed you. Some witch has blown on the knots
against you."<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>"I am not mad, Sire," said the culprit, "but a poor
castaway on your coast."</p>

<p>"Hear him, poor fellow! so mad that he knows not
himself. Well! well! I must forgive you then for
not knowing me," said Mahomet, with genuine pity.
"Did you love me so, old comrade, that my harsh
words knocked over your reason? or did your reason,
toppling over, lead you to challenge me as you
did? We must cure this malady, though it takes the
treasure of the empire to do it." Lowering his voice
he addressed the Vizier:</p>

<p>"I could not believe that my faithful comrade would
have rebelled. It was not he, but the demon who
has possessed him. Think you not so, good Kalil?"</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span></p>

<p>The Vizier bowed in assent to the Sultan's theory,
and whispered, "It provides a wise escape from antagonizing
the Janizaries. But you should summon a
physician."</p>

<p>Clapping his hands, an attendant appeared, who
was dispatched for the court physician; a man of
fame in his profession, whose duty it was to be always
within call of the Sultan.</p>

<p>The physician entering, examined the culprit,
looking into his eyes, balancing his head between his
hands to determine if there were any sudden disturbance
of the proportionate avoirdupois; noting if
his tongue lay in the middle of his mouth, and feeling
his pulse. At length he said in low voice to the
Sultan and Vizier:</p>

<p>"There is, Sire, no outward evidences of lacking
wit. I would have him speak."</p>

<p>"He is the Janizary, Captain Ballaban," whispered
the Vizier. "You will observe that the wit is clean
gone from him. Tell us your story, Ballaban, or
whoever you are."</p>

<p>"I beg the favor of your excellency, your lordship,
Sire; for, since you deny that you are the king
of the Turks, I know not what title to give to your
authority. I am your prisoner. I fought on the
Byzantine galley as Jesu gave me strength, but was
unfortunate enough to fall overboard, and fortunate
enough to avoid capture by the Turkish boats, as I
dived beneath them, or rested myself below their
sterns until I reached the shore. But as heaven
willed it, I landed below the walls of the city. I was
altogether weaponless, having shuffled off my armor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
that I might swim&mdash;and altogether blown by my effort&mdash;or,
by the bones of Abraham! I had never been
captured by the cowardly slaves you sent. I ask only
the treatment of an honorable enemy."</p>

<p>"By the beard of the Prophet!" exclaimed Mahomet,
"if he were a Christian I would give him liberty for
the valor of his speech. Some of the spirit of our
gallant Ballaban is still left in him. The witches
could not take the great heart out of him, though they
stole away his wits. What say you, Sage Murta?"
The physician replied, knitting his brows and stroking
his chin&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Padishah is wise. The man is mad. But
since his heart is not touched by the demon, but only
his memory erased and his imagination distorted, my
science tells me there is hope of his cure."</p>

<p>"What medicament have you for a diseased mind?"
asked the Sultan.</p>

<p>With reverent pomposity, but in low voice not overheard
by the patient, the physician uttered the prescription:</p>

<p>"First, we have the religious cure&mdash;if so be that
the man is under the charm of the evil spirits&mdash;Find
thee a cord with eleven knots tied on it:&mdash;for such was
the number on the cord with which the daughters of
Lobeid, the Jew, bewitched the Prophet. As thou untiest
the knots repeat the last two chapters of the
Koran, which the Angel Gabriel revealed as the talisman,
saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I fly for refuge unto the Lord of the daybreak, that
he may deliver me from the mischief of the night,
when it cometh on; and from the mischief of women,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
blowing on the knots; and from the mischief of the
envious; and from the mischief of the whisperer, the
devil, who slyly withdraweth, who whispereth evil suggestions
into the breasts of men: and from genii and
men.'</p>

<p>"If this should fail&mdash;as I have known it to fail in
the case of those who were not born in the sacred family
of Islâm&mdash;we should try the virtues of the heritage bowl,
which is much esteemed among the Giaours. I have
possessed myself of one, once the property of an ancient
family. It is made of silver, and engraved with
forty-one padlocks. A decoction mixed in this bowl,
and poured on the head of the patient any time within
seven weeks after the day on which they celebrate the
imagined rising of Jesu, son of Mary, from the dead,
will often break the most malignant spell. The Christian
Paska<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> is just past; so that it will be opportune."</p>

<p>"But should this likewise fail?" asked Mahomet,
impatient with the sage's prolixity.</p>

<p>"Ah! we shall then have to try our strictly human
remedies. This ailment is called by the Latin disciples
of Galen, <i>dementia</i>, which signifieth that the man's
mind, his natural thoughts, have gone away from him.
We must recall them. For this we must have some
strong appeal to that which was his hottest passion or
interest before his mind flew away from him. Do you
know the absorbing humor of this man? Was he a
lover? If so, we must find the fair one who has
robbed him of his better part, and, restoring her to
him, we shall restore him to himself."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Mahomet. "Captain Ballaban was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
never enamored of woman. The maid who lured the
Prophet from the charms of Ayesha and Hafsa,<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
would not have turned Ballaban's head. I once offered
him the choice of a bevy of Georgians; but he
would not even look at them. He is a soldier; from
tassel to shoe-thong a soldier."</p>

<p>"Ah! then we have the remedy at hand," said
Murta, rolling his eyes as if reading the prescription
in the air. "Give him command; military excitement;
honors of the field. When the cimeters gleam then
will reason flash again. And my science is at fault
if the simple summons to some high duty work not a
counter charm to break the spell that is on him,
though it were woven by the mystic dance of all the
genii and devils."</p>

<p>"We will try this last remedy first," said Mahomet.
"Dismiss him. Let him go as he will, without hindrance
or seeming to follow, until my orders be brought
him by his Aga. In the meantime search the shore
for the knotted cord the witches may have blown
upon. And, good Murta, send for the silver bowl; for
my brain is that hot that I fear me the Giaour ghosts we
have sent gibbering to hell during the last few days
have left the spell of their evil eyes upon me too."</p>

<p>The following day was not far advanced when Captain
Ballaban was summoned to the Sultan's tent, the rumor
of his restoration to royal favor having been made
to precede the summons. In fact, after the affair of
the preceding afternoon, Ballaban had not gone to
the sea shore, but retired to his own quarters, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
he loyally awaited either his death summons, or an
invitation for some wild frolic with the Padishah; he
knew not which, so thought about neither; but busied
himself over a plan for a new gun-carriage he was
going to submit to Urban.</p>

<p>With assumed stolidity he entered the royal tent.
As he rose from his obeisance upon the earth, his majesty
embraced him with boyish delight.</p>

<p>"Your old self again: I see your soul in your face.
I'd give half the horse-tails in the empire rather
than lose that shock of hair from my sight, or the glowing
brain that is under it from my councils, my red-headed
angel!"</p>

<p>"There is no need to lose it, except by cutting it off
at my shoulders," said Ballaban, falling in with the
humor of the Sultan, yet watchful not to be taken
unawares, if, in its fitfulness, that humor should turn.</p>

<p>"I have a grand service for you, if you have skill
and courage enough to execute it," said Mahomet,
watching the effect on his friend.</p>

<p>The captain's eyes flashed with the prospect, as he
said:</p>

<p>"I wait your plan, Sire; only let it be bold."</p>

<p>"I have no plan, you must make one. I would see
if your brain is as square as the pot you keep it in,"
said the Sultan, tapping him on the head with a
jewelled whip staff, and adding,</p>

<p>"It is evident, Captain, that we must get possession
of the Golden Horn; for so long as the enemy hold
that for their harbor, we cannot prevent their reprovisioning
the city as they did yesterday; and a few
more such auxiliaries as they brought, indeed, another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
such leader as the Genoese Giustiniani, would compel
us to raise the siege. How can we take the harbor?
Our boats can never raise the chain at the mouth."</p>

<p>"That has been my problem since the siege began,"
said Ballaban. "I remember while in Albania, as I
lodged one night in a village, I met with some Italian
officers, who had come to offer their swords to Castriot.
They told how they moved their fleet overland,
several miles on a roadway of timbers.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> We can use
that device. The thing is not impracticable; for there
is a depression to the north of Galata, through which
from the Bosphorus to the inland extremity of the
Golden Horn is but five or six miles. Our vessels are
not large; could be transported with the multitudes
of our troops, and on the still water of the harbor
would soon, by superior numbers, capture those of the
Christians."</p>

<p>"A good conception!" said Mahomet, "and if my
reading has not been at fault, the Roman Augustus
did something similar.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> It shall be done. Let it not
be said that the Ottoman was surpassed in daring or
difficulty of enterprise by Pagan or Christian. You
shall perform it, Ballaban. The woods above Galata
will serve for planking, and the engineers can be
spared from before the walls until it is accomplished."</p>

<p>A few days later a large fleet of the Moslems was
conveyed overland, by means of a roadway of greased
timbers. To the amazement of the Christians their
adversary's navy no longer lay idly upon the Bosphorus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
but was transformed into a line of floating batteries
within the harbor of the Golden Horn, and
from their rear soon destroyed the fleet of the
defenders.</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER XLI.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he city was now completely invested. Menaced
from all sides, the defenders were not sufficient
in numbers to guard the many approaches. Yet the
daily fighting was desperate, for the Moslems were
inspired by the certainty of success, while the Christians
were nerved with the energy of despair. To end
the siege Mahomet designated a time for a combined
assault from sea and land.</p>

<p>As the fatal day dawned, numberless hordes moved
towards the walls. The great ditches were soon
filled with the dead bodies of thousands of the least
serviceable soldiers, who had been driven from behind
by the lances of the trained bands, that they might
thus worry the patience and exhaust the resources of
the brave defenders, without taxing the best of the
Moslem troops. The carcasses of the slain made a
highway for the living, over which they poured
against the gate of St. Romanus. The four grim
towers toppled beneath the pounding of great stone
balls hurled from the cannon of Urban. The defenders
were driven off the adjacent walls by the storms of
bullets and arrows that swept them. At the critical
moment the Janizaries, unwearied as yet by watching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
or fighting, twelve thousand strong, as compact a mass
beneath the eye of the Sultan as the weapon he held
in his hand, moved to where the breach was widest.</p>

<p>"The spoil to all! A province to him who first
enters!" cried the Sultan, waving his iron battle
mace. Hassan, the giant, first mounted the rampart,
and fell pierced with arrows and crushed with stones.
But through the gap his dying valor had made in the
ranks of the foe first rushed the company of Ballaban.</p>

<p>In vain did the people crowd beneath the dome of
St. Sophia, grasping with hopeless hope an ancient
prophecy that at the extreme moment an angel would
descend to rescue the city. Alas! only the angel of
death came that day; and to none brought he more
welcome news than to the Emperor,&mdash;"Thy prayer is
answered; for thou hast fallen where the dead lie
thickest!" Near the gateway of St. Romanus, where
he had met the first of the invaders, under the piles
of the dead, gashed by sabre strokes and crushed
beneath the feet of the victors, lay the body of Constantine
Palæologus, the noblest of the Cæsars of the
Eastern Empire!</p>

<p>The Turks placed his ghastly head between the
feet of the bronze horse, a part of the equestrian statue
of Justinian, where it was reverently saluted even by
the Moslems, who paused in the rage of the sack to
think upon the virtue and courage of the unfortunate
monarch.</p>

<p>Captain Ballaban had pressed rapidly through the
city to the doors of St. Sophia. The oaken gates
flew back under the axes of the Moslems. Monks and
matrons, children and nuns, lords and beggars were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
crowded together, not knowing whether the grand
dome would melt away and a legion of angels descend
for their relief, or the vast enclosure would become a
pen of indiscriminate slaughter. The motley and helpless
misery excited the pity of the captors. Ballaban's
voice rang through the arches, proclaiming safely to
those who should submit. That he might the better
command the scene, he made his way to the chancel
in front of the grand altar. It was filled with the
nuns, repeating their prayers. Among them was the
fair Albanian. Her face was but partly toward him,
yet he could never mistake that queenly head. She
was addressing the Sisters. Holding aloft the bright
shaft of a stiletto, she cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let us give ourselves to heaven, but never to the
harem!"</p>

<p>Ballaban paused an instant. But that instant
seemed to him many minutes. As, under the lightning's
flash, the whole moving panorama of the wide landscape
seems to stand still, and paints vividly its
prominent objects, however scattered, upon the startled
eye of the beholders; so his mind marvellously quickened
by the excitement, took in at once the long track
of his own life. He saw a little child's hand wreathing
him with flowers plucked beside a cottage on the
Balkans; a lovely captive whose face was lit by the
blazing home in a hamlet of Albania; a form of one
at Sfetigrade lying still and faint with sickness, but
radiant as with the beginning of transfiguration for the
spirit life; and the queenly being who was borne in
the palanquin through the gate of Phranza. But how
changed! How much more glorious now! Earthly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
beauty had become haloed with the heavenly. He
never had conceived of such majesty, such glory of
personality, such splendor of character, as were
revealed by her attitude, her eye, her voice, her
purpose.</p>

<p>"But now," thought he, "the descending blade will
change this utmost sublimity of being into a little heap
of gory dust!"</p>

<p>All this flashed through his mind. In another
instant his strong hand had caught the arm of the
voluntary sacrifice. The stiletto, falling, caught in the
folds of her garments, and then rang upon the marble
floor of the chancel. Morsinia uttered a shriek and
fell, apparently as lifeless as if the blade had entered
her heart.</p>

<p>The Janizary stood astounded. A tide of feeling
strange to him poured through his soul. For the
first time in his life he felt a horror of war. Not
thousands writhing on the battle field could blanch
his cheek with pity for their pangs: but that one
voice rang through and through him, and rent his
heart with sympathetic agony. Her cry had become
a cry of his own soul too.</p>

<p>For the first time he realized the dignity of
woman's character. This woman was not even
wounded. She had fallen beneath the stroke of a
thought, a sentiment, a woman's notion of her honor!
The women he had known had no such fatal scruples.
Other captive beauties soon became accustomed to
their new surroundings. Many even offered to buy
with their charms an exchange of poverty for the
luxuries of the harem of Pashas and wealthy Moslems.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
Was this a solitary woman's tragedy of virtue? Or
was it some peculiar teaching of the Christian's faith
that inspired her to such heroism? However it came,
the man knew that with her it was a mighty reality;
this instinct of virtue; this sanctity of person.</p>

<p>And this woman was his dream made real! A
celestial ideal which he had touched!</p>

<p>The man's brain reeled with the shock of these
tenderer and deeper feelings, coming after the wildness
of the battle rage. He grasped the altar for support.
The blood seemed to have ceased to bound in his
veins, the temples to be pulseless; a band to have been
drawn tightly about his brain so as to paralyze its
action. He felt himself falling. A deathly sickness
spread through his frame. He was sure he had
fainted. He thought he must have been unconscious
for a while. Yet when he opened his eyes, the soldier
near him was in the same attitude of dragging a nun
by her wrists as when he last saw him. Time had
stood still with his pulses. He shuddered at the
cruelty on every side, as the shrieks from the high
galleries were answered by those in distant alcoves
and from the deep crypt. He watched the groups of
old men and children, monks and senators, nuns and
courtesans, tied together and dragged away, some for
slaughter, some for princely ransom, some for shame.</p>

<p>The building was well emptied when the Sultan
entered.</p>

<p>He at once advanced to the altar and proclaimed:</p>

<p>"God is God; there is but one God, and Mahomet
is the apostle of God!"</p>

<p>"But whom have we here, Captain Ballaban?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span></p>

<p>"Your Majesty, I am guarding a beautiful captive
whom I would not have fall into the hands of the
common soldiers; I take it, of high estate," replied
the Janizary, knowing that such an introduction to the
royal attention alone could save her from the fate
which awaited the unhappy maidens, most of whom
were liable to be sold to brutal masters and transported
to distant provinces.</p>

<p>The Sultan gazed upon the partly conscious woman,
and commanded,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let her be veiled! Seek out a goodly house. Find
the Eunuch Tamlich." Ballaban shuddered at this
command, and was about to reply, when his judgment
suggested that he was impotent to dispute the royal
will except by endangering the life or the welfare of
his captive.</p>

<p>The safest place for her was, after all, with the
maidens who were known to be the choice of the
Sultan, and thus beyond insult by any except the
imperial debauchee.</p>

<p>Mahomet II. gave orders for the immediate transformation
of the Christian temple of St. Sophia into a
Mosque. In a few hours desolation reigned in those
"Courts of the Lord's House," which, when first completed,
ages ago, drew from the imperial founder, the
remark: "Oh, Solomon! I have surpassed thee!"
and which, though the poverty of later monarchs had
allowed it to become sadly impaired, was yet regarded
by the Greek Christians as worthy of being the vestibule
of heaven.</p>

<p>The command of the Sultan: "Take away every
trace of the idolatry of the infidel!" was obeyed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
demolishing the rarest gems of Christian art to which
attached the least symbolism of the now abolished
worship. The arms were chiseled off the marble
crosses which stood out in relief from the side walls,
and from the bases of the gigantic pillars. The rare
mosaics which lined the church as if it were a vast
casket&mdash;the fitting gift of the princes of the earth to
the King of Kings&mdash;were plastered or painted over.
The altar, that marvellous combination of gold and
silver and bronze, conglomerate with a thousand
precious stones, was torn away, that the red slab of
the Mihrab might point the prayers of the new devotees
toward Mecca. The furniture, from that upon the
grand altar to the banners and mementoes of a thousand
years, the donations of Greek emperors and
sovereigns of other lands, was broken or torn into
pieces. There remained only the grand proportions
of the building&mdash;its chief glory&mdash;enriched by polished
surfaces of marble and porphyry slabs; the superb
pillars brought by the reverent cupidity of earlier ages
from the ruined temple of Diana at Ephesus, the
temple of the Sun at Palmyra, the temple on the Acro-Corinthus,
and the mythologic urn from Pergamus,
which latter, having been used as a baptismal font
by the followers of Jesus, was now devoted to the
ablutions of the Moslems.</p>

<p>From St. Sophia the Sultan passed to the palace of
the Greek Cæsars.</p>

<p>"Truly! truly!" said he "The spider's web is the
royal curtain; the owl sounds the watch cry on
the towers of Afrasiab," quoting from the Persian
poet Firdusi, as he gazed about the deserted halls.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
He issued his mandate which should summon
architects and decorators, not only from his
dominions, but from Christian nations, to adorn the
splendid headland with the palatial motley of walls
and kiosks which were to constitute his new seraglio.</p>

<p>The considerateness of Ballaban led him to select
the house of Phranza as the place to which Morsinia
was taken. The noble site and substantial structure
of the mansion of the late chamberlain commended it
to the Sultan for the temporary haremlik; and the
familiar rooms alleviated, like the faces of mute friends,
the wildness of the grief of their only familiar captive.</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER XLII.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>onstantine, after his escape from the Sultan's
tent, where he had been taken for the demented
Ballaban, was unable to enter Constantinople before it
fell. His heart was torn with agonizing solicitude for
the fate of Morsinia. He knew too well the determination
of the dauntless girl in the event of her falling
into the hands of the Turks. Filling his dreams at
night, and rising before him as a terrible apparition by
day, was that loved form, a suicide empurpled with its
own gore. Yet love and duty led him to seek her, or at
least to seek the certainty of her fate. He therefore
disguised himself as a Moslem and mingled with the
throng of soldiers and adventurers who entered the
city under its new possessors. He wandered for hours
about the familiar streets, that, perchance, he might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
come upon some memorial of her. The secrets of
the royal harem he could not explore, even if suspicion
led his thought thither. The proximity of the
residence of Phranza was guarded by the immediate
servants of the Sultan, so that he was deprived of
even the fond misery of visiting the scenes so associated
with his former joy.</p>

<p>In passing through one of the narrowest and foulest
streets&mdash;the only ones that had been left undisturbed
by the Vandalism of the conquerors&mdash;he came upon
an old woman, hideous in face and decrepit, whom he
remembered as a beggar at the gate of Phranza.
From her he learned many stories of the last hours of
the siege.</p>

<p>According to her story she had gone among the
first to St. Sophia. When the Moslems entered they
tied her by a silken girdle to the person of the
Grand Chamberlain, and, amid the jeers of the soldiers,
marched them together to the Hippodrome. She
remembered the Sultan as he rode on his horse,&mdash;how
he struck with his battle hammer one of the silver
heads of the bronze serpents, and cried: "So I smite
the heads of the kingdoms!" Just as he did so he
turned, and saw her in her rags tied to the courtly-robed
lord, and in an angry voice commanded that the
princely man be loosed from contact with the filthy
hag. Phranza was taken away: but nobody cared to
take her away. She was trampled by the crowd, but
lived. And nobody thought of turning her out of her
hovel home. She was as safe as is a rat when the
robbers have killed the nobler inmates of a house.</p>

<p>The woman said that she had heard that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
daughter of Phranza was sent away somewhere to
an island home. But the Albanian Princess,&mdash;Yes,
she knew her well; for no hand used to drop so
bountifully the alms she asked, or said so kindly
"Jesu pity you, my good woman!" as did that beautiful
lady. The beggar declared that she stood near
her by the altar in St. Sophia. "She looked so
saintly there! There was a real aureole about her
head as she prayed, so she was a saint indeed. Then
she raised her dagger!" But the wretched watcher
could watch no longer, though she heard her cry, so
wild that she would never cease to hear it.</p>

<p>The beggar ceased her story; all her words had cut
through her listener's heart as if they had been
daggers.</p>

<p>"It is well!" he said, "I will go to Albania.
Among those who loved her I will worship her memory;
and, under Castriot, I will seek my revenge."</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER XLIII.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>orsinia's fears, and her horror at the anticipated
life in the harem, were not confirmed by
its actual scenes. Except for the constant surveillance
of the Nubian eunuchs and female attendants, there
was no restriction upon her liberty. She passed
through the familiar corridors, and rested upon the
divan in what had been her own chamber in better
days. Other female captives became her companions;
but among them were none of those belonging to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
Constantinople. Suburban villages were represented;
but most of the odalisks<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> were Circassian beauties,
whose conduct did not indicate that they felt any shame
in their condition. They indulged in jealous rivalry,
estimating their own worth by the sums which the
agents of the Sultan had paid their parents for their
possession; or bantering one another as to who
of their number would first meet the fancy of their
royal master. There were several Greeks, who, with
more modesty of speech, spared none of the arts of
the toilet to prepare themselves to better their condition
in the only way that was now open to them. A
Coptic girl had been sent by Eenal, the Borghite
Khalif of Egypt, as a present to the Sultan. Her
form was slight, and without the fullness of development
which other races associate with female beauty,
but of wonderful grace of pose and motion; her face
was broad; eyes wide and expressionless; mouth
straight. Yet her features had that symmetry and
balance which gave to them a strange fascination.
The Turcoman Emir who had already given his
daughter to Mahomet&mdash;the nuptials with whom he
was celebrating when called to the throne&mdash;exercised
still further his fatherly office in presenting to his
son-in-law as fine a pair of black eyes as ever flashed
their cruel commands to an amative heart. To study
this physiognomical museum afforded Morsinia an entertaining
relief from the otherwise constant torture of
her thoughts.</p>

<p>To her further diversion one was introduced into
the harem who spoke her own Albanian tongue. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
new comer was of undoubted beauty, so far as that
quality could be the product of merely physical
elements. It was of the kind that might bind a god
on earth, but could never help a soul to heaven. Her
lower face, with full red lips arching the pearliest
teeth, and complexion ruddy with the glow of health,
shading into the snowy bosom, might perhaps serve to
make a Venus; but her upper features, the low forehead
and dilated nostrils, could never have been made
to bespeak the thoughtful Minerva in this retreat of
those, who, to the Moslem imagination, are the types of
heavenly perfection. Her eyes were bright, but only
with surface lustre. Her nature evidently contained
no depths which could hold either noble resentment
or self sacrificing love; either grand earthly passion
or heavenly faith.</p>

<p>This woman's vanity did not long keep back the
story of her life. She told of her conquest of the
village swains who fought for the possession of her
charms; of the devotion of an Albanian prince who
took her dowerless in preference to the ladies of great
family and fortune, and would have bestowed upon her
the heirship to his estates: of how she was stolen away
from the great castle by a company of Turkish officers,
who afterward fought among themselves for the
privilege of presenting her to the Validé Sultana;<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
for it was about the time of the Ramedan feast when
the Sultan's mother made an annual gift to her son of
the most beautiful woman she could secure. The vain
captive declared that the jealousy of the odalisks at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
Adrianople had led the Kislar Aga to send her here
to Constantinople.</p>

<p>"And who was the Albanian nobleman whose bride
you had become?" asked Morsinia.</p>

<p>"Oh, one who is to be king of Albania one day,
the Voivode Amesa."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Morsinia, "this is news from my country.
When was it determined that Amesa should be
king?"</p>

<p>"Oh! every one speaks of it at the castle as if it
were well understood. And when he becomes king
then he will claim me again from Mahomet, though he
must ransom me with half his kingdom. Yes, I am
to be a queen; and indeed I may be one already, for
perhaps Lord Amesa is now on the throne. And that
is the reason I wear the cord of gold in my hair; for
one day my royal lover will put the crown here."</p>

<p>The bedizened beauty rose and paced to and fro
through the great salôn. The pride which gave the
majestic toss to her head, however it would have
marred that ethereal form which the inner eye of the
moralist or the Christian always sees, and which is
called character, only gave an additional charm to
her;&mdash;as the delicate yet stately comb of the peacock
adds to the fascination of that bird. Her carriage
combined the gracefulness of perfect anatomy and
health with the dignity which conceit, thoroughly
diffused in muscle and nerve, lent to all her movements.
With that step upon it no carpet beneath a throne
would have been dishonored. Her dress was in
exquisite keeping with her person. The close fitting
zone or girdle about her waist left the bust uncontorted;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
a model which needed no device to supplement
the perfection of nature. A robe of purple
velvet trailed luxuriantly behind; but in front was
looped so as to display the loose trousers of white silk
which were gathered below the knee and fell in full
ruffles about the unstockinged ankles, but not so
low as to conceal the rings of silver which clasped
them, and the slippers of yellow satin, ending in long
and curved points, which protruded from beneath.</p>

<p>As the other women gazed at this self-assumed queen
of the harem the green fire of jealousy flashed alike
from black eyes and blue. The straight thin noses of
the Greeks for the moment forgot their classic models,
and dilated as if in rivalry of that flattened feature of
the Egyptian; while the straight mouth of the daughter
of the Nile writhed in indescribable curves, indicative
of commingled wrath, hatred, pique and scorn.</p>

<p>This parade would have produced in Morsinia the
feeling of contempt, were it not for that sisterly
interest which was awakened by the fact that she was
her own country-woman. Morsinia's face, usually
calm in its great dignity and reserve, now flushed with
the struggle between indignation and pity for the girl.</p>

<p>At this moment the purple hangings which separated
the salôn from the open court were held aside by the
silver staff of the eunuch in charge; and the young
Padishah stood as a spectator of the scene.</p>

<p>"Ah! Tamlich," cried he, addressing the black
eunuch, "you were right in saying that the great haremlik
at Adrianople, with its thousand goddesses,
could not rival this temporary one for the fairness of
the birds you have caged in it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span></p>

<p>The women made the temineh&mdash;a salutation with the
right hand just sweeping the floor, and then pressed
consecutively to the heart, the lips and the forehead;
a movement denoting reverence, and, at the same time,
giving field for the display of the utmost grace of motion.</p>

<p>The Padishah passed among these his slaves with
the license which betokened his absolute ownership;
stroking their hair and toying with their persons according
to his amiable or insolent caprice. Morsinia,
however, was spared this familiarity. The Sultan himself
colored slightly as he addressed her a few words in
Greek, of which language, in common with several
others, he knew enough to act as his own interpreter.
His questions were respectful, all limited to her
comfort in her new home. With Elissa, the queenly
Albanian, he was at once on terms of intimacy. Her
manner betokened that she gave to him only too willingly
whatever he might be disposed to take.</p>

<p>As the Sultan withdrew, the eunuch Tamlich
remarked to him:</p>

<p>"My surmise of your Excellency's judgment was
verified. Said I not that the two Arnaouts were the
fairest? And did I not behold your Majesty gaze
longest upon them?"</p>

<p>"I commend your taste, Tamlich," replied Mahomet.
"But those two are as unlike as a ruby and a
pearl."</p>

<p>"But as fair as either, are they not? The chief
hamamjina<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> declares that the blue-eyed one has the
most perfect form she ever saw; and that it is a form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
which will improve with years. Morsinia Hanoum<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
will be more fit for Paradise, while Elissa Hanoum
may lose the grace of the maiden as a matron. But
the cherry is ripe for the plucking now."</p>

<p>"I like the ruby better than the pearl," said the
Sultan. "I cannot quite fathom the deep eye of the
latter. She thinks too much. I would not have
women think. They are to make us stop thinking.
The problems of state are sufficiently perplexing: I
want no human problem in my arms."</p>

<p>"But one who thinks may have some skill in affording
amusement. Have I not heard thee say, Sire,
'Blessed is the one who can invent a new recreation?'
That requires thinking."</p>

<p>"Right, Tamlich! can she sing?"</p>

<p>"Ay! your Majesty, to the Greek cythera; and
such songs that, though they know not a word of
them&mdash;for the songs are in her own Arnaout tongue&mdash;the
odalisks all fall to weeping."</p>

<p>"I like not such singing," said Mahomet. "To make
people think with her thoughtful eyes is bad enough
in a woman. To make them weep with her voice is
wicked, is Christian. I will give her away to some one
who wants a wife that thinks. There is Hamed Bey,
one of the muderris<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> who is to be put at the head of
my new chain of Ulemas.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> He will want a wife who
thinks; and his eyes are that blind with dry study that
it will do him good to weep. But who is the woman?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
I think I saw her face in St. Sophia the day of our
entry."</p>

<p>"She belonged to the house-hold of Phranza, the
Chamberlain, who possessed this very house," replied
the eunuch. "And I think, from its goodly size and
decoration, he must have used the treasury of the
empire freely."</p>

<p>"To Phranza! Why, I have a daughter of his in
the nursery at Adrianople. His wife I have given to
the Master of the Horse.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> His son I have this day
sent to hell for his insolence. But she is an Arnaout;
therefore not of kin to Phranza. Search out her story,
Tamlich! For a member of the family of Phranza,
and not of his blood, may be of some political consequence.
I will keep her. But get her story, Tamlich,
get her story!"</p>

<p>"I have it already, Sire," replied the eunuch.</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"She is a ward of Scanderbeg, the Arnaout traitor,
sent to Constantinople to escape the danger of capture
by thine all-conquering arms. But the bird fled from
the fowler into the snare."</p>

<p>"Perhaps a child of Scanderbeg! Eh, Tamlich?
One at least whose life is of great value to him, and
was to the Greek empire. I will inform Scanderbeg
that she is in my possession. By the dread of what
may happen to her I shall the easier force that ravening
brute to make terms; for I am tired of battering
my sword against his rocks, trying to prick his skin.
Keep her close, Tamlich, keep her close!"</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIV.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ate in the day the Sultan retired to a neighboring
mansion, once possessed by the Greek Grand
Duke, Lucas Notaras, and there sought relaxation
from the incessant cares of the empire. The day had
been wearisome. Architects had submitted plans for
the detailed ornamentation of the new seraglio which
was rising on the Byzantine Point. One of the plans
led to dispute between the Padishah and the chief Mufti,
the expounder of the Moslem law. It was occasioned
thus. The porphyry column<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> which stood hard by
the palace of the Greek emperors, had once served to
hold aloft the bronze statue of Apollo, a precious
relic of ancient Greek mythology. This was afterward
reverenced by the people as the figure of the Emperor
Constantine the Great, or worshipped by them as
that of Christ. An architect proposed that the time-glorious
shaft should now be surmounted by the
colossal statue of Mahomet II. The Mufti declared the
project to be impious, as tempting to idolatry, against
which the Koran was so clear and denunciatory, and
also the Sounna or traditional sayings of the Prophet.
The Sultan's pride rebelled against this assumption of
an authority above his own. But the Sultan's superstitious
regard for the faith among the people, which
led him to wash his hands and face openly whenever
he spoke with the architect, who was a Christian engaged
at great cost from Italy, also led him to fear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
to break with the prescriptions and customs of his
religion in this matter. He contented himself with an
oath that he had sooner lost the honor of a campaign
than the privilege of seeing himself represented as the
conqueror of both Constantine and Christ. Generals,
too, had been in council with him that day regarding
the conduct of intrigues for the possession of the
Peloponnesus, and about the wars in Servia, Boznia
and Trebizond. Ill tidings had come from Albania,
where Scanderbeg was consuming the Turkish armies,
as a great spider entraps in his webs and at his
leisure devours a swarm of hornets, which, could they
have free access to him, would instantly sting him to
death. The messenger who brought this news was
rewarded by having hurled at his head an immense
vase of malachite, in the exertion of lifting which the
imperial wrath was sufficiently eased to allow of his
turning to other business. A plan for the reception
of the inmates of the grand harem at Adrianople, when
they should be transported to the spacious buildings
being constructed for them in the seraglio, was also a
pleasing diversion, and led the Sultan to make the
brief visit to the fair ones at the house of Phranza,
which has been described. But the nettled spirit of the
Padishah was far from subdued. He had during
the day given an order, the sequel to which we must
relate, and which, while it disturbed his conscience
and flooded him at moments with the sense of self-contempt,
also inflamed his natural passion for cruelty.
He determined to drown the noble, and to satiate the
the vicious, craving by an hour or two of unrestrained
debauch.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span></p>

<p>In the court of the house of the Grand Duke
Notaras was spread the royal banquet. Rarest viands
were flanked by flagons of costliest wines. Upon the
momentary surprise of the steward when he received
the order to provide the wines, the monarch cried in a
contemptuous tone:</p>

<p>"Ah! I know your thoughts. It is not according to
the Koran that wine should be drunk. But by the
staff of Moses,<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> which they found in the palace of the
Cæsars yonder, I swear that Mahomet the Emperor
shall not yield to Mahomet the Prophet in everything.
The Prophet made laws to suit his own taste, so
will I<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>. He can have Mecca and Medina and
Jerusalem; but I shall reign without him in my own
palace in Stamboul, which I have captured with my
own hand. Bring the wine, or I'll spill your black
blood as a beverage to those in hell! It will be sweet
enough for your kin who are black with roasting. I
will have wine to-day! Cool it in all the snows from
Mount Olympus yonder; for my blood is as hot as if I
were shod with fire; and my skull boils like a pot."<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>About the table were divans cushioned with down
and covered with yellow silk. The Padishah took his
seat upon the highest cushion. By his side stood the
chief of the black eunuchs, splendidly<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> attired in the
waistcoat of flower embroidered brocade, tunic of scarlet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
flowing trousers, red turban, and half boots of bronzed
leather. He held a wand of silver covered with elegant
tracery and topped in filagree. As he waved this
symbol of his office, there came from the various doors
opening into the court groups of the harem women.
They were draped in gauze, in the folds of which
sparkled diamonds and glowed the hues of precious
stones selected by the taste of the chief eunuch to
set off the complexion and hair of their various wearers,
and at the same time to facilitate their grouping into
sets of dancers. The court was made radiant with
these beautiful forms, which moved in circles or in
spirals about the fountains and under the orange
trees, whose white blossoms and golden fruit in
simultaneous fulness completed the picture for the eye,
while their fragrance loaded the air with its delicate
delight.</p>

<p>The Kislar Aga had arranged a scene which especially
pleased the monarch, whose head was already
swimming with the combined effect of the mazy dance
and the fumes of the wine. An attendant led into
the court, held partly by a strong leash and partly by the
voice of his trainer, a magnificent leopard. With
utmost grace the beast leaped over the ribboned wand,
falling so softly to the ground that, though of enormous
weight, he would not seemingly have broken a twig
had it lain beneath his feet. In imitation of this, a
eunuch led into the court by a leash of roses a Circassian
dancer, the gift of a Caramanian prince. Her
form was as free from the hindrances of dress as that
of her spotted competitor; except that a bright gem
burned upon her forehead, in the node which gathered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
a part of her hair; while the abundance of her tresses
was either held out on her snowy arms, or fell about
her as a veil almost to her feet. With a hundred variations
the girl repeated the motions of the leopard,
leaping the wands with equal grace as she came to
them in the measures of the dance.</p>

<p>The great brute had laid his head in the lap of his
trainer, and was watching his beautiful rival with
apparent enjoyment; only now and then uttering a
low growl as if in jealousy, when the Bravo! of the
Sultan rewarded some especially fascinating movement.
The girl came to the side of the magnificent monster
and dropped her long hair over his head. The brute
closed his eyes as if soothed by the wooing of the
maiden. Cautiously, but encouraged by the low voice
of the trainer, she placed her head upon the mottled
and living pillow. A great paw was thrown about
her shoulder.</p>

<p>The Sultan was in ecstasy of applause, and shouted:</p>

<p>"A collar of gold for each of them!"</p>

<p>The girl attempted to rise, but her splendid lover
seemed to have become really enamored of the
beautiful form he held. Her slightest motion was
answered by a growl; while the swaying of his tail
indicated that, as among human kind, so with the
brutes, the softest sentiments were to be guarded by
those of a severer nature; that baffled love must meet
the avenging of cruel wrath. Like the affection of
some men, that of the leopard was limited to its own
gratification, and utterly regardless of the comfort
of its object; for the fondness of the brute was not
such as to prevent his long nails protruding through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
their velvet covering, and entering the bare flesh of
the girl. She quivered with pain, yet, at the quick
warning of the trainer, she made no outcry. The
man drew from his pocket a small bit of raw flesh, and
diverted the eyes of the brute from the blood streaming
at each claw-puncture on the neck and bosom of
his victim. The leopard savagely snapped at the
morsel, and, at the same instant struck it with his paw,
and leaped to seize it as it was hurled many feet away.
The girl as quickly darted to a safe distance. Attendants
instantly appeared and surrounded the beast
with their spear points. He crouched at the feet of
the trainer, and whined in fear until he was led
out.</p>

<p>The girls then encircled the seat of the Sultan, and
vied with one another in the simulated attempt to
throw over him a spell. Nor was the attempt merely
simulated, as each one displayed the utmost art of
beauty and manner to win from the half-drunken
tyrant some token of his favor.</p>

<p>When Elissa came near the Sultan, he bade her play
with him as the Circassian did with the leopard. He
held her and exclaimed to the others:</p>

<p>"Beware your leopard when he growls! but where
is the other Arnaout? I will have the pearl with the
ruby of the harem! where is she, I say? Did I not
order you to bring all the odalisks to my feast?"</p>

<p>"From your Majesty's orders but lately, Sire, I
supposed&mdash;" began the eunuch.</p>

<p>"Supposed? You are to obey, not to suppose,"
cried the demented man, slashing at him with the
cimeter that lay at his feet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span></p>

<p>"But she is not robed for the feast."</p>

<p>"Bring her as she is, and robe her here. You said
that she was fairer than this one. If she is not fairer
than this one, the leopard's claws will grip her, and
the beast shall have your black body for his next
supper. Bring her!"</p>

<p>The eunuch soon returned with Morsinia. She
wore a sombre feridjé, or cloak completely enveloping
the person. This she had on at the moment she
was summoned, and the eunuch obeyed literally the
mandate of the monarch to bring her as she
was.</p>

<p>As she stood before the Sultan she appeared, in
contrast with her half naked and bejeweled sisters,
like a prophetess; some female Elijah before Ahab
surrounded by his household of Jezebels. Throwing
back the yashmak, or long veil&mdash;the one Moslem
costume she had very willingly assumed after her
captivity&mdash;she gazed upon the tyrant with a look of
amazed inquiry of his meaning in summoning her to
such a place. The sovereignty of her soul asserted
and expressed itself in her noble brow, her clear and
steady eye, her dauntless bearing.</p>

<p>"Sire, I have obeyed," said she, making the obeisance
which in form was obsequious, but which she
executed with such dignity that even the dull wit of
the reveller felt that she had not really humbled herself
before him by so much as the shadow of a
thought.</p>

<p>"Disrobe her!" cried the monarch.</p>

<p>The woman stepped back, as if to avoid the contact
of her person with the black eunuch; but as suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
threw off the feridjé herself. If she had seemed
a gloomy prophetess before, her appearance now
would have suggested to an ancient Greek the
apparition of Pudicitia, the goddess of modesty.
Her gown of rich pearl-tinted cloth covered her
shoulders; and, though opened upon the bosom, it
was to show only the thick folds of white lace which
embraced the throat in a ruffle, and was clasped with
a single gem&mdash;a cameo presented to her by the Greek
Emperor.</p>

<p>The bearing of the woman gave a temporary check
to the abominable rage of the royal wretch, and
recalled him to his better judgment. For it was a
peculiarity of Mahomet that no passion or debauch
could completely divert him from carrying out any
plan he had devised pertaining to his imperial ambition.
As certain musicians perform without the sacrifice
of a note the most difficult pieces, when too
drunk to hold a goblet steadily to their lips, and as
certain noted generals have staggered through the
battle without the slightest strategic mistake, so Mahomet
never lost sight of a political or military purpose
he had formed. While sleeping and waking,
in the wildest revelry and in the privacy of his unspeakable
sensuality, that project blazed before him like a
strong fire-light through the haze.</p>

<p>"Take her away! Take her away!" said he to
the eunuch, recollecting his purpose of using her in
his negotiations with Scanderbeg; and covering his
retreat from his original command by the remark,
"She is the woman who thinks, I want none such
to put her head against my heart. She might discover
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
my thoughts; and by the secrets of Allah! if a
hair of my beard knew one of my thoughts I would
pluck it out and burn it."<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>As Morsinia withdrew, a eunuch approached and
whispered to the Sultan.</p>

<p>"Ah! it is good! good!" cried the Monarch.
"My Lord, the Grand Duke Notaras, will revisit his
mansion. For him we have provided a feast such
as his master Palæologus never gave him. Ah! my
lovely Arnaout shall sit at my right hand&mdash;for the
queen of beauty has precedence to-day," said he,
addressing Elissa. "And the Egyptian shall make
me merry with the music of her voice, which I doubt
not is sweeter than the strains of her native Memnon.
And, Tamlich, you shall do me the honor of representing
the king of Nubia, and lie there opposite."</p>

<p>The eunuch stood bewildered; for never before had
a Moslem proposed to introduce into his harem the
person of any man, as now the Duke of Notaras was
to look upon the beauties who should be reserved
solely for the feasting of the Padishah's eyes.</p>

<p>Mahomet, knowing his thoughts, bade him obey,
and cried,</p>

<p>"Let the fair houris veil their faces with their
blushes. Bring in Notaras!"</p>

<p>Three blacks entered, each bearing a great salver,
on which was a covered dish of gold.</p>

<p>"To Tamlich I demit the honors of the board,"
said he, waving the foremost waiter toward the eunuch,
whose face almost blanched at the strange turn affairs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
were taking, or perhaps with the suspicion that to-morrow
his head would fall from his shoulders as the penalty
of having witnessed the Padishah disgrace himself.</p>

<p>The attendants placed the dishes before the eunuch
and the two favored beauties. The covers removed
revealed the ghastly sight of three human heads, their
unclosed eyes staring upward from their distorted
faces and gory locks. The eunuch leaped from the
divan. The women fell back shrieking and fainting.
They were the heads of the Grand Duke Notaras and
his two children.</p>

<p>Well did the Sultan need the strong diversion of the
drunken revelry to drown the thoughts of what he knew
to be transpiring at the hour. In spite of his royal
word to the distinguished captive who had made his
submission absolute, except to the extent of seeing his
children dishonored to the vilest purposes, Mahomet
had ordered that Notaras should be beheaded at the
Hippodrome, having been first compelled to witness
the decapitation of his family.</p>

<p>Even Mahomet was sobered by the horrid ghoulism
he had devised, and dismissed the terror-stricken
revelers with a volley of curses.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER XLV.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he courage of Morsinia when she appeared before
Mahomet had been stimulated by an event which
occurred a little before her summons.</p>

<p>She was sitting by the latticed window in the house
of Phranza. It overlooked the wall surrounding the
garden, which on that side was a narrow enclosure.
This had been her favorite resort in brighter days.
From it she could see what passed in the broad highway
beyond, while the close latticed woodwork prevented
her being seen by those without. While musing there
she was strangely attracted by an officer who frequently
passed. His shape and stature reminded her
strongly of Constantine. As he turned his face toward
the mansion the features seemed identical with
those of her foster brother. Recovering from the
stroke of surprise this apparition gave her, Morsinia
rubbed her eyes to make sure she was not dreaming,
and looked again. He was in conversation with
another. It could not be Constantine, for, aside from
the general belief in Constantine's death before the
termination of the siege, this person was saluted with
great reverence by the soldiers who passed by, and
approached with familiarity by other officers of
rank.</p>

<p>The sight brought into vivid conviction what had
long been her day dream, namely, that Michael, her
childhood playmate, might be living, and if so, would
probably be among the Turkish soldiers; for his
goodly physique and talent, displayed as a lad, would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
certainly have been cultivated by his captors. She
now felt certain of her theory. So strong was the
impression, and so active and exciting her thoughts
as she endeavored to devise a way by which the discovery
might be utilized to the advantage of both, that
even the loathsome splendor of the Sultan's garden
party, had not impressed her as it otherwise would
have done.</p>

<p>For several days after she was almost oblivious to the
monotony of the harem life; so busy was she with her
new problem. She determined that, at any cost, she
would bring herself into communication with the
officer, and, if her theory should be confirmed, declare
herself, and boldly propose that he should rescue her.
For she could not conceive that, however much he
had become accustomed to Turkish life, he had lost
all yearning for his liberty and all impression of his
Christian faith.</p>

<p>But how could she convey any intelligence to him?
Except through the eunuchs, the inmates of the
harem had little communication with the outer world.
The customs of life there were as inflexible as the
walls.</p>

<p>To her natural ingenuity, now so quickened by necessity
and hope, there at length appeared an end thread
of the tangle. The women of the harem relieved the
tedium of their existence by making various articles,
the construction of which might not mar the delicacy
of their fingers; such as needlework upon their own
clothing, coverings for cushions, curtains, tapestried
hangings, spreads for couches, cases in which the
Koran could be kept so that even when being read it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
need not be touched by the fingers, bags of scented
powders, and the like. Many of these articles were
disposed of at the bazaars of the city, and the proceeds
spent by the odalisks at their own caprice;
generally for confections and gew-gaws. At the time
there was quite a demand for articles made in the
harem. Many thousands of Moslems had been
imported from Asia Minor to take the place of the
rapidly disappearing Greek population. Large stores
of articles were sent from the great harem at Adrianople,
and sold for fabulous prices in the bazaars of
Stamboul, as the new capital was called by the Turks.
The agents for the sale of these things were generally
the female attendants at the harem, who had free
association with the bazaar keepers. Sometimes these
women sold directly to the individual purchasers
without going to the trade places. An officer or young
citizen was often inveigled into buying, and paying
exorbitant prices too, on hearing that some odalisk
had set longing eyes upon him, and wrought the purse
or belt, the dagger-sheath or embroidered jacket, as a
special evidence of her favor. Many were the stories
which the gallants of the city and garrison were accustomed
to tell, as they displayed their purchases, about
nocturnal adventures, in which they were guided only
by a pair of bright eyes, and of favors received from
beauties whose names, of course, prudence forbade
them to mention. All the traditions of lovers, romances
of moon-shadowed grottoes, and all the stories of
castles with the thread at the window, that have been
told from the beginning of the world, had their counterpart
in those the swains of Stamboul told about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
the Sultan's earthly paradise at Adrianople, or those
which, in their amatory bantering, they had made to
cluster about the villa of the late Phranza at the new
capital.</p>

<p>An old woman, who, formerly a servant in the
harem, had been given by the Validé Sultana, the
mother of Amurath, to a subaltern officer as wife, but
had long been a widow, was permitted freely to enter
the haremlik, and engaged as a convenient broker
between those within and those without. One day
Morsinia, in giving her some of her handiwork for
sale, held up an elegant case of silk containing
several little crystals, or phials, of atar of roses.</p>

<p>"Kala-Hanoum, do you know the young Captain
Ballaban?"</p>

<p>"Ay, the Knight of the Golden Horn?" asked
the woman.</p>

<p>"And why do they call him that?"</p>

<p>"Because," she replied, "his head glows like one, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is the man&mdash;Well! find him&mdash;Tell him any
story you please about my beauty."</p>

<p>"I need not invent one; I must only tell the truth
to bewitch him," replied the old dame, with real fondness
and admiration. "But that will be difficult. I
can invent a lie better than describe the truth, unless
you help me."</p>

<p>"Well," said Morsinia, "tell him as much truth about
my appearance as you can, and invent the rest. Tell
him&mdash;let me see&mdash;that my eyes are as bright as the
stars that shine above the Balkans."</p>

<p>"Do they shine there more brilliantly than here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
where they make their toilet in the Bosphorus?"
asked the woman.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," said Morsinia, "for the air is clearest
there of any place on the earth. Tell him, too, that my
teeth are as white as the snows that lie in the pass of
Slatiza."</p>

<p>"Where is that?" queried the messenger.</p>

<p>"Oh! it is a grotto I have heard of, that lies very
high up toward the sky, where the snows are unsoiled
by passing through the clouds, which, you know,
always tints them. And then tell him that altogether I
am as queenly as&mdash;as&mdash;well! as the wonderful Elizabeth
Morsiney, the bride of the Christian king Sigismund."</p>

<p>"Elizabeth Morsiney? yes, I will remember that
name, if some day you will tell me her story."</p>

<p>"That I will," said Morsinia. "And tell the young
officer that the odalisk who made this lovely case has
dreamed of him ever since she was a child."</p>

<p>"He cannot resist that," said the woman.</p>

<p>"But you must sell it to no one else. And see this
elegant sash of cashmere! I will give it to you to sell
on your own account, Hanoum, if you bring me some
sure evidence that he has bought the case of perfume.
And be sure to tell him that just when the sun is setting
he must go somewhere alone, and look at the
sun through each of the little phials, and he may see
the face of her who sent them; for you know that a
true lover can always see the one who sends a phial
of atar of roses in the sun glints from its sides.
And when you bring me evidence that he has bought
it, then, good Kala, you shall have the sash of cashmere."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
The old woman's cupidity hastened her feet
upon her errand.</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER XLVI.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">"P</span>eace be with thee!" said the old woman,
dropping a low courtesy to the officer, as he
walked near the new buildings of the seraglio.</p>

<p>"Peace be unto <i>thee</i>, and the mercy of God and His
blessing,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> good woman!" replied the soldier; but
waving his hand, added kindly, "I have no need of
your harem trumpery."</p>

<p>"But see this!" said she, showing the elegant case
of perfumery. "This holds the essence of the flowers
of paradise."</p>

<p>"Go along, old mother! I would have no taste for
it if it contained the sweat of the houris."<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>"But this case was made especially for you, Captain
Ballaban."</p>

<p>"Or for any other man whose purse will buy it,"
replied he, moving away.</p>

<p>The woman followed closely, chattering into his
deaf ears.</p>

<p>"But, could you see her that made it, you would not
decline to buy, though you gave for it half the gold
you found in the coffers of the rich Greeks the day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
your valor won the city, brave Captain; and the cost
of it is but a lira;<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and the maiden is dying of love
for you."</p>

<p>"Then why does she not give it to me as a present?
Love asks no price," said he, just turning his head.</p>

<p>"That she would, but for fear of offending your
honor by slighting your purse," said the quick-witted
woman.</p>

<p>"Well said, mother! I warrant that the Beyler
Bey, or the noble Kaikji,<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> who made love to you never
got you for nothing."</p>

<p>"Indeed, no! He paid the Validé Sultana ten provinces,
and a brass buckle besides, to prevent her giving
me to Timour; who took it so hard that he would
have broken his heart, but that the grief went the
wrong way and cracked his legs, and so they call him
Timour-lenk. That was the reason he made war on
the Ottomans. It was all out of jealousy for me,"
said she, making a low and mock courtesy. "But if
you could see the beautiful odalisk who made this!
Her form is as stately as the dome of St. Sophia."</p>

<p>"She's too big and squatty, if she's like that,"
laughed the officer.</p>

<p>"Her face glows in complexion like the mother of
pearl," went on the enthusiastic saleswoman.</p>

<p>"Too hard of cheek!" sneered the other. "Even
yours, Hanoum, is not so hard as mother of pearl."</p>

<p>"A neck like alabaster&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cold! too cold! I would as soon think of making
love to a gravestone," was the officer's comment.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span></p>

<p>"And such melting lips&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, with blisters! I tell you, old Hanoum, I'm
woman proof. Go away!"</p>

<p>"And her eyes shine through her long lashes like
the stars through the fir trees on the Balkans."</p>

<p>"Tut! Woman, you never saw the stars shine
on the Balkans. They do shine there, though, like the
very eyes of Allah. A woman with such eyes would
frighten the Padishah himself."</p>

<p>Kala Hanoum took courage at this first evidence of
interest on the part of the officer, and plied her advantage.</p>

<p>"And her teeth are as white as the snows in the
grotto of Slatiza&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The grotto of Slatiza? You mean some bear's
cave. But the snows are white there, whiter and
purer than anywhere else on earth, except as I once
saw them, so red with blood, there in the Pass of
Slatiza. But how know you of Slatiza, my good
woman?"</p>

<p>"And altogether she is as fair as the bride of Sigismund
of Hungary," said Kala, without regarding his
question.</p>

<p>"And who was she, Hanoum?" asked the man,
with curiosity fully aroused.</p>

<p>"Why, Elizabeth Morsiney, of course."</p>

<p>The officer turned fully toward the woman, and
scanned closely her features as if to discover something
familiar. Was there not some hint to be picked
from these words?</p>

<p>"Hanoum, who told you to say that?"</p>

<p>The woman in turn studied his face before she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
replied. She would learn whether the allusions had
excited a pleasant interest, or roused antagonism in
him. It required but a moment for her to discover
that Morsinia had given her some clue that the man
would willingly follow, so she boldly replied:</p>

<p>"The odalisk herself has talked to me of these
things."</p>

<p>"The odalisk! What is she like?" said he eagerly.
"Describe her to me."</p>

<p>"Why, I have been describing her for this half-hour;
but you would not listen. So I will go off
and do my next errand."</p>

<p>The woman turned away, but, as she intended it
should be, the officer was now in the attitude of the
beggar.</p>

<p>"Hold, Hanoum, I will buy your perfume&mdash;But tell
me what she is like in plain words. Is she of light
hair?"</p>

<p>"Ay, as if she washed it in the sunshine and dried
it in the moonlight, and as glossy as the beams of
both."</p>

<p>"Think you she belonged to Stamboul before the
siege?"</p>

<p>"Ay, and to the great Scanderbeg before
that."</p>

<p>The officer was bewildered and stood thinking,
until Kala interrupted him.</p>

<p>"But you said you would buy it, Captain."</p>

<p>"Did I? Well, take your lira."</p>

<p>As the woman took the piece of money she added:
"And don't forget that the odalisk said she had
dreamed of you since she was a child, and that at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
sunset if you looked through the phials you would see
her face."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, woman!"</p>

<p>"But try it, Sire, and maybe the noble Captain
would send something to the beautiful odalisk?"</p>

<p>"Yes, when I see her in the phial I will send her
myself as her slave."</p>

<p>The man thrust the silken case into the deep
pocket of his flowing vest and went away.</p>

<p>Then began a struggle in Captain Ballaban. Since
the capture of the fair girl by the altar of St. Sophia,
he had been unable to efface the remembrance of
her. She stood before him in his dreams: sometimes
just falling beneath the dagger; sometimes in
the splendor which he imagined to surround her in
the harem; often in mute appeal to him to save her
from the nameless horrors which her cry indicated that
she dreaded. When waking, his mind was often distracted
by thoughts of her. The presence of the
Sultan lost its charm, for he had come to look upon
him as her owner, and to feel himself in some way
despoiled. He was losing his ambition for distant
service, and found himself often loitering in the vicinity
of the Phranza palace.</p>

<p>This feeling which, perhaps, is experienced by most
men, at least once in life, as the spell of a fair face is
thrown over them, was associated with a deeper and
more serious one in Captain Ballaban.</p>

<p>From the day of her capture until now he had felt
almost confident of her identity with his little playmate
in the mountain home. She thus linked together
his earliest and later life; and, as he thought of her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
he thought of the contrast in himself then and now.
The things he used to muse about when a child, his
feelings then, his purposes, his religious faith, all came
back to him, and with a strange strength and fascination.
He began to realize that, though he was an
enthusiast for both the Moslem belief and the service
of the Ottoman, yet he had become such, not in his
own free choice, but by the overpowering will of others.
At heart he rebelled, while he could not say
that he had come to disbelieve a word of the
Koran, and was not willing to harbor a purpose
against the sovereignty of the Padishah. Still he was
compelled to confess to himself that, if the fair woman
were indeed his old play-mate, and there was open
a way by which he could release her from her captivity,
he would risk so much of disloyalty to the Sultan as
the attempt should require. Indeed, he argued to
himself that, except in the mere form of it, it would
not be disloyalty; for what did Mahomet care for one
woman more or less in his harem? And was this
woman not, after all, more his property than she was
that of the Padishah? He had captured her; perhaps
twice; and had saved her life in St. Sophia, for
only his hand caught her dagger. She was his!</p>

<p>Then he became fond of indulging a day dream.
The Sultan sometimes gave the odalisks to his favorite
pashas and servants. What if this one should be
given to him?</p>

<p>He had gone so far as once to say in response to
the Sultan, who twitted him for being in love, that he
imagined such to be the case, and only needed the
choice of His Majesty to locate the passion. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
he did not dare to be more specific, lest he might run
across some caprice of the Sultan; for he felt sure
that so beautiful an odalisk as his captive would not
long be without the royal attention.</p>

<p>Old Kala Hanoum's information regarding the fair
odalisk allayed the turmoil in Ballaban's breast, in
that it gave certainty to his former suspicions. For
her words about the stars above the Balkans, the snows
of Slatiza, and Elizabeth Morsiney, were not accidental.
He had no doubt that the Albanian odalisk
was the little lady to whom he once made love in the
bowers of blackberry bushes, and vowed to defend
like a true knight, waving his wooden sword over the
head of the goat he rode as a steed. In the midst of
such thoughts and emotions, Captain Ballaban awoke
to full self-consciousness, and said to himself&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am in love! But I am a fool! For a man with
ambition must never be in love, except with himself.
Besides, this woman I love is perhaps half in my
imagination; for I never yet caught a full view of her
face. As for her being my little Morsinia&mdash;Illusion!
No! this is no illusion! But what if she be the same!
Captain Ballaban, are you going to be a soldier, or a
lover? Take your choice; for you can't be both, at
least not an Ottoman soldier and a lover of a Christian
girl."</p>

<p>Rubbing his hand through his red hair, as if to pull
out these fantasies, he strode down to the water's
edge, and, tossing a Kaikji a few piasters, was in a
moment darting like an arrow across the harbor;&mdash;a
customary way the captain had of getting rid of any
vexation. The cool evening breeze wooed the over-thoughtfulness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
from his brain, or he spurted it out
through his muscles into the oar blades, which dropped
it into the water of oblivion.</p>

<p>He was scarcely aware that he was becoming more
tranquil, when a quick cry of a boat keeper showed
that he had almost run down the old tower of white
marble which rises from a rocky islet, just away
from the mainland on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus.</p>

<p>"Kiss-Koulessi, the Maiden's Tower, this," he muttered.
"Well, I have fled from the fortress of one
maiden to run against that of another. Fate is against
me. Perhaps I had better submit. Why not? Wasn't
Charis a valiant general of the old Greeks, who sent
him here, once on a time, to help the Byzantines?
Well! He had a wife, the fair Boiidion, the 'heifer-eyed
maiden.' And here she lies beneath this tower.
The world would have forgotten General Charis, but
for his wife Damalis, whom they have remembered
these two thousand years. A wife <i>may</i> be the making
of a man's fame. If the Sultan would give me my
pick of the odalisks I think I would venture."</p>

<p>These thoughts were not interrupted, only supplemented,
by the sun's rays, now nearly horizontal,
as striking the water far up the harbor of Stamboul,
they poured over it and made it seem indeed a Golden
Horn, the open end of which extended into the Bosphorus.
The ruddy glow tipped the dome of St.
Sophia as with fire; transformed the gray walls of the
Genoese tower at Galata into a huge porphyry column,
sparkling with a million crystals; and made the white
marble of the Maiden's Tower blush like the neck of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
a living maiden, when kissed for the first time by the
hot lips of her lover.</p>

<p>So the Captain thought: and was reminded to
inspect the silken treasure he had purchased. He
would look through the phials, as&mdash;who knows&mdash;he
might see the face of her who sent them. If looking
at the red orb of the sun, just for an instant, made his
eyes see a hundred sombre suns dancing along the
sky, it would not be strange if his long meditation
upon a certain radiant maiden should enable him to
see her, at least in one shadowy reproduction of his
inner vision.</p>

<p>He drew the silken case from his pocket. It was
wrought with real skill, and worth the lira, even if it
had contained nothing, and meant nothing. The
little phials were held up one by one, and divided the
sun's beams into prismatic hues as they passed
through the twisted glass. In each was a drop or two
of sweet essence, like an imprisoned soul, waiting to
be released, that it might fly far and wide and distill
its perfume as a secret blessing.</p>

<p>"But this one is imperfect," muttered the Captain,
as he held up a phial that was nearly opaque. It was
larger than the others, and contained a tightly wrapped
piece of paper. "The clue!" said he, and, after
a moment's hesitation, broke the phial. Unwinding
the paper, he read:</p>

<p>"You are Michael, son of Milosch. I am Morsinia,
child of Kabilovitsch. For the love of Jesu! save me
from this hell. We can communicate by this means."</p>

<p>It was a long row that Captain Ballaban took that
night upon the Bosphorus. Yet he went not far, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
back and forth around the new seraglio point, scarcely
out of sight of the clear-cut outline of the Phranza
Palace, as it stood out against the sky above the
ordinary dwellings of the city. The dawn began to
peer over the hills back of Chalcedon, and to send its
scouts of ruddy light down the side of Mt. Olympus,
when he landed. But the length of the night to him
could not be measured by hours. He had lived over
again ten years. He had gone through a battle which
tired his soul as it had never been tired under the
flashing of steel and the roar of culverin. Only once
before, when, as a mere child he was conquered by the
terrors of the Janizaries' discipline, had he suffered so
intensely. Yet the battle was an undecided one. He
staggered up the hill from the landing to the barracks
with the cry of conflict ringing through his soul. "What
shall I do?" On the one side were the habit of loyalty,
his oath of devotion to the Padishah, all his earthly
ambition which blazed with splendors just before him&mdash;for
he was the favorite of both the Sultan and the
soldiers&mdash;and all that the education of his riper years
had led him to hope for in another world. On the
other side were this new passion of love which he
could no longer laugh down, and the appeal of a helpless
fellow creature for rescue from what he knew was
injustice, cruelty and degradation;&mdash;the first personal
appeal a human being had ever made to him, and he
the only human being to whom she could appeal. To
heed this cry of Morsinia he knew would be treason
to his outward and sworn loyalty. To refuse to heed
it he felt would be treason to his manhood. What
could he do? Neither force was preponderating.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span></p>

<p>The battle wavered.</p>

<p>What did he do? What most people do in such
circumstances&mdash;he temporized: said, "I will do
nothing to-day." Like a genuine Turk he grunted to
himself, "Bacaloum!" "We shall see!"</p>

<p>But though he arranged and ordered an armistice
between his contending thoughts, there was no real
cessation of hostilities. Arguments battered against
arguments. Feelings of the gentler sort mined incessantly
beneath those which he would have called
the braver and more manly. And the latter counter-mined:
loyalty against love: ambition against pity.</p>

<p>But all the time the gentler ones were gaining
strength. On their side was the advantage of a
definite picture&mdash;a lovely face; of an immediate and
tangible project&mdash;the rescue of an individual. The
danger of the enterprise weighed nothing with him, or,
at least, it was counter-balanced by the inspiriting
anticipation of an adventure, an exploit:&mdash;the very
hazard rather fascinating than repelling. Yet he had
not decided.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLVII.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>aptain Ballaban was summoned by the
Sultan.</p>

<p>"Well, comrade," said Mahomet, familiarly throwing
his arm about his friend, much to the disgust of
the Capee Aga, the master of ceremonies, through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
whom alone it was the custom of the Sultans to be
approached.</p>

<p>"Well! comrade, I gave a necklace worth a thousand
liras to a girl who pleased me in the harem."</p>

<p>"Happy girl, to have pleased your Majesty. That
was better than the necklace," replied Ballaban.</p>

<p>"Think you so? Let me look you through and
through. Think you there is nothing better in this
world than to please the Padishah? Ah! it is worth
a kingdom to hear that from a man like you, Ballaban.
Women say it; but they can do nothing for me.
They dissipate my thoughts with their pleasuring me.
They make me weak. I have a mind to abolish the
whole harem. But to have a man, a strong man, a man
with a head to plot for empire and to marshal armies, a
man with an arm like thine to make love to me! Ah,
that is glorious, comrade. But let me make no mistake
about it. You love me? Do you really think no gold,
no honors, could give you so much pleasure as pleasing
me? Swear it! and by the throne of Allah! I
will swear that you shall share my empire. But to
business!" dropping his voice, and in the instant
becoming apparently forgetful of his enthusiasm for
his friend.</p>

<p>"We make a campaign against Belgrade. I must
go in person. Yet Scanderbeg holds out in Albania.
It is useless meeting him in his stronghold. You cannot
fight a lion by crawling into his den. He must
be trapped. Work out a plan."</p>

<p>"I have one which may be fruitful," instantly replied
Captain Ballaban.</p>

<p>"Ah! so quick?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span></p>

<p>"No, of long hatching, Sire. I made it in my first
campaign in Albania with your royal father. The
young Voivode Amesa is nephew to Scanderbeg.
He is restless under the authority of the great
general: has committed some crime which, if known,
would bring him to ruin: is popular with the people
of the north."</p>

<p>"Capital!" said Mahomet eagerly. "I see it all.
Work it out! Work it out! He may have anything,
if only Scanderbeg can be put out of the way, and
the country be under our suzerainty. Work it out!
And the suzerain revenues shall all be yours; for by
the bones of Othman! there is not a province too
great for you if only you can settle affairs among the
Arnaouts.</p>

<p>"And now a gift! I will send you the very queen of
the harem."</p>

<p>"My thanks, Padishah, but I&mdash;&mdash;" began Ballaban,
when he was cut short by the Sultan.</p>

<p>"Not a word! not a word! I know you decline to
practice the softer virtues, and prefer to live like
a Greek monk. But you must take her. If you like
her not, drown her. But you shall like her. By the
dimple in the chin of Ayesha! she is the most perfect
woman in the empire."</p>

<p>"But," interposed Ballaban, "I am a Janizary,
and it is not permitted a Janizary to marry."</p>

<p>"A fig for what is permitted! When the Padishah
gives, he grants permission to enjoy his gifts.
Besides, you need not marry. You can own her;
sell her if you don't like her. But you must take
her."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span></p>

<p>"Of what nation is she? Perhaps I could not
understand her tongue," objected Ballaban.</p>

<p>"So much the better," said Mahomet. "Women
are not made to talk. But this woman is an
Arnaout, from Scanderbeg's country."</p>

<p>Captain Ballaban could scarcely believe his ears.</p>

<p>This then is Morsinia! To have her, to save her
without breach of loyalty! This was too much.
With strangely fluttering heart he acquiesced, and his
thanks were drawn from the bottom of his soul.</p>

<p>The next day he sought Kala Hanoum, and sent
by her to Morsinia a gem enclosed in a pretty casket,
with which was a note, reading,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It shall be so. Patience for a few days, and our
hearts shall be made glad."</p>

<p>How strangely Fate had planned for him! It must
have been Fate; for only powers supernal could have
made the gift of the Padishah so fitting to his heart.
No chance this! His secret passion, unbreathed to
any ear on earth, had been a prayer heard in
heaven!</p>

<p>Ballaban was now an undoubting Moslem that he
found Kismet on the side of his inclinations. He belonged
to Islâm, the Holy Resignation; resigned to the
will of Providence, since Providence seemed just now to
have resigned itself to his will. He was surprised at
the ecstatic character his piety was taking on. He
could have become a dervish: indeed his head was
already whirling with the intoxication of his prospects.</p>

<p>Captain Ballaban, like a good Moslem, went to the
Mosque. He made his prayer toward the Mihrab;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
but his eyes and thoughts wandered to the spot at the
side of it, where he had saved the life of Morsinia;
and he thanked Allah with full soul that he had been
allowed to save her for himself.</p>

<p>The Padishah, the following day, bade Ballaban
repair to a house in the city, and be in readiness to
receive the gift of heaven and of his own imperial
grace. On reaching the place an elderly woman&mdash;the
Koulavous, an inevitable attendant upon marriages&mdash;conducted
him through the selamlik and mabeyn
to the haremlik of the house. The bride or slave, as
he pleased to take her, rose from the divan to meet
him. Though her thick veil completely enveloped her
person, it could not conceal her superb form and
marvellous grace. His hand trembled with the agitation
of his delight as he exercised the authority
of a husband or master, and reverently raised the
veil.</p>

<p>He stood as one paralyzed in amazement. She was
not Morsinia. She was Elissa!</p>

<p>He dropped the veil.</p>

<p>Strange spirits seemed to breathe themselves in
succession through his frame.</p>

<p>First came the demon of disappointment, checking
his blood, stifling him. Not that any other mortal
knew of his shattered hopes; but it was enough that
he knew them. And with the consciousness of defeat,
a horrible chagrin bit and tore his heart, as if it had
been some dragon with teeth and claws.</p>

<p>Then came the demon of rage; wild rage; wanting
to howl out its fury. He might have smitten the
veiled form, had not the latter, overcome by her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
bewilderment and the scorn of him she supposed to
have been a lover, already fallen fainting at his feet.</p>

<p>Then rose in Ballaban's breast the demon of vengeance
against the Sultan. Had Mahomet been
present he surely had felt the steel of the outraged
man. Only the habit of self-control and quiet review
of his own passions prevented his seeking the Padishah,
and taking instant vengeance in his blood.</p>

<p>Then there came into him a great demon of impiety,
and breathed a curse against Allah himself through
his lips.</p>

<p>But finally a new spirit hissed into his ears. It was
Nemesis. He felt that this was the moment when a
just retribution had returned upon himself. For he
well knew the face that lay weeping beneath the heap
of bejewelled lace and silk. It was that of the Dodola,
whom he had flung into the arms of the Albanian
Voivode Amesa when he was awaiting the embrace of
some more princely maiden. And now the sarcasm of
fate had thrown her into his arms.</p>

<p>"Allah! Thou wast even with me this time," he
confessed back of his clenched teeth.</p>

<p>"But doubtless," he thought, "it was through the
information I gave to the Aga that this girl has been
stolen away from Amesa."</p>

<p>"Would that heaven rid me of her so easily!" he
muttered. "Yet that is easy; thanks to our Moslem
law, which says, 'Thou mayest either retain thy wife
with humanity or dismiss her with kindness.'<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Yet I
cannot dismiss her with kindness. She can not go
back to the royal harem. If I dismiss her I harm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
her, and Allah's curse will be fatal if I wrong this
creature again&mdash;to say nothing of the Padishah's if I
throw away his gift. I must keep her. Well! Bacaloum!
Bacaloum! It is not so bad a thing after all to
have a woman like that for one's slave; for a wife
without one's heart is but a slave. Well!" He raised
the veil again from the now sitting woman.</p>

<p>The mutually stupid gaze carried them both through
several years which had passed since they had parted
at Amesa's castle.</p>

<p>Elissa was easily induced to tell her story. Assuming
that it might be already known to her new lord,
she gave it correctly; and therefore it differed substantially
from that she had told to Morsinia. She had
been but a few days in Amesa's home when he discovered
that she was not the person he had presumed
her to be. In an outburst of rage he would have taken
her life, but was led by an old priest to adopt a more
merciful method of ridding himself of her. To have
returned her to the village above the Skadar would
have filled the country with the scandal, and made
Amesa the laughing stock of all. She was therefore
sent within the Turkish lines, with the certainty of
finding her way to some far-distant country. Her
beauty saved her from a common fate, and she was
sent as a gift to the young Padishah by an old general,
into whose hands she had fallen.</p>

<p>Ballaban assured the woman of his protection, and
also that the time would come when he would compensate
her for any grief she had endured through his
fault. In the meantime she was retained in the luxurious
comfort of her new abode.
</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER XLVIII.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>aptain Ballaban was almost constantly
engaged at the new seraglio. It was being constructed
not only with an eye to its imposing appearance
from without and its beauty within, such as
befitted both its splendid site between the waters and
the splendor of the monarch whose palace it was to be;
but also with a view to its easy defence in case of
assault. Upon the young officer devolved the duty
of scrutinizing every line and layer that went into the
various structures.</p>

<p>He was especially interested in the side entrances,
and communications between the various departments
of the seraglio. He gave orders for a change to be
made in the line of a partition and corridor, and also
for a slight variation in the position of a gateway in
the walls dividing the mabeyn<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> court from that of the
haremlik. Just why these changes were made, perhaps
the architects themselves could not have told;
nor were they interested to enquire, supposing that
they were made at the royal will. Ballaban was disposed
to indulge a little his own fancy. If there was
to be a broad entrance for public display, and then a
narrow passage for the Sultan only, why not have a
way through which he could imagine a fair odalisk
fleeing from insult and torture into the arms of&mdash;himself?
But Ballaban's face grew pale as he watched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
the completion of a sluice way leading from a little
chamber, down through the sea wall, to meet the
rapid current of the Bosphorus. He remembered the
declaration of the Padishah, that, if ever an odalisk
were unfaithful to him, she should be sewn into a bag,
together with a cat and a snake, and drowned in
Marmora.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>In the meantime old Kala Hanoum was amazed at
the number of articles of Morsinia's handiwork she
was able to induce the young captain to purchase.
Indeed, he never refused. And quite frequently she
was the bearer of gifts, generally confections, sometimes
little rolls of silk suitable for embroidery with
colored threads or beads, accompanied by the name
of some fellow officer of the Janizaries from whom
apparently an order for work was given; the Captain
acting as an agent in a sort of co-partnership with
Kala. Of course this was only secret mail service
between Ballaban and the odalisk. If Kala suspected
it, her commissions were so largely remunerative
that she silenced the thought of any thing but
legitimate business.</p>

<p>Ballaban devised plans for her escape which Morsinia
found it impracticable to execute from her side
of the harem wall; and her shrewdest suggestions
were pronounced equally unsafe by the strategist
without. Ballaban had caught glimpses of Morsinia
while loitering among the trees at the upper end of the
Golden Horn, by the Sweet Waters, where the ladies of
the harem were taken by the eunuchs on almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
weekly excursions. He had proposed to have in
readiness two horses, that, if she should break from
the attendants, they might flee together. But before
this could be accomplished, the excursions were discontinued,
as the attention of all was turned to a new
pleasure.</p>

<p>The grand haremlik was at length completed.
Perhaps no place on earth was so suggestive of indolent
and sensual pleasure as this. There were luxurious
divans, multiplying mirrors, baths of tempered
water, fountains in which perfumes could be scattered
with the spray, broad spaces for the dance, half hidden
alcoves for the indulgence in that which shamed the
more public eye, and gardens in which Araby competed
with Africa in the display of exotic fruits and
flowers.</p>

<p>A day was set for the reception of the grand harem
from Adrianople&mdash;which contained nearly a thousand
of the most beautiful women in the world&mdash;into this
new paradise. The Kislar Aga had arranged a
pageant of especial magnificence, which could be witnessed
by the people at a distance. Two score
barges, elegantly decorated, rowed by eunuchs, their
decks covered with divans, were to receive the odalisks
from Adrianople at the extreme inner point of
the seraglio water front on the Golden Horn. The
Validé Sultana's barge was to lead the procession,
which should float to the cadences of music far out
into the harbor. At the same time, the Sultan in his
kaik, and the women of the temporary haremlik, each
propelling a light skiff decorated with flags and
streamers, were to move from the extreme outer point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
of the seraglio grounds, until the two fleets should
meet, when, amid salvos of artillery from the shores,
the odalisks with the Sultan were to turn about and
lead their sisters to the water gate of the haremlik.
Orders were given forbidding the people to appear
upon the water, or upon the shores within distance
to see distinctly the faces of the ladies of the harem.</p>

<p>Every evening at sundown a patrol of eunuchs made
a cordon of boats a few hundred yards from the
shore, within which, screened by distance from the eyes
of common men, the odalisks went into training for
the great regatta. The Padishah, sitting in his barge,
encouraged their rivalry by gifts for dexterity in managing
the little boats, for picturesqueness of dress and
for grace of movement, as with bared arms and streaming
tresses, they propelled the kaiks.</p>

<p>Morsinia found herself one of the most dexterous in
handling the oars. The free life of her childhood on
the Balkans and among the peasants of upper Albania,
had developed muscle which this new exercise soon
brought into unusual efficiency. She observed that
the attendant eunuchs were deficient in this kind of
strength, and had no doubt that, with her own light
weight, she could drive the almost imponderable kaik
swifter than any of them.</p>

<p>The young Egyptian woman was her only competitor
for the honor of leading the fleet on the day of
the regatta. To add to the interest of the training,
Mahomet ordered that the two should race for the
honor of being High Admiral of the harem fleet; and
one evening announced that the competitive trial
should take place the next afternoon. The course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
was fixed for a half mile, just inside of Seraglio
Point, where the waters of the harbor are still, unvexed
by the rapid current which pours along the channel
of the Bosphorus. The flag-boat was to be anchored
almost at the meeting of the inner and outer waters.</p>

<p>That night Morsinia wrote a note containing these
words&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"About dusk just below the Seven Towers watch
for kaik.

<span class="i10 smcap">Morsinia.</span>"</p>
</div>
<p>Kala Hanoum was commissioned early the following
morning to deliver a pretty little sash, wrought with
stars and crescents, to Captain Ballaban. Morsinia
was careful to show Kala the scarf, and dilate upon
the peculiar beauty of the work until the woman's
curiosity should be fully satisfied; thus making
sure that she would not be tempted to inspect it for
herself. She then wrapped the note carefully within
the scarf, and tied it strongly with a silken cord.</p>

<p>Old Kala had a busy day before her, with a dozen
other commissions to discharge. But fortune favored
her in the early discovery of the well known shape of
the Captain in ordinary citizen's dress, as he was
engaged in eager conversation with the Greek monk,
Gennadius, whom the Sultan had allowed to superintend
the worship of the Christians still resident in
the city. Indeed Mahomet was wise enough to even
pension some of the Greek clergy to keep up the
establishment of their faith; for he feared to antagonize
the millions in the provinces of Greece who
could not be persuaded to embrace Islam; and was
content to exact from them only the recognition of his
secular supremacy. Kala Hanoum had too much reverence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
in her nature to interrupt a couple of such worthies;
so she followed a little way behind them. They
came to the gate-way&mdash;a mere hole in the wall&mdash;which
led to what was known as the Hermit's Cell, the abode
of Gennadius during the siege. The spiritual pride
of the monk had prevented his exchanging this for a
more commodious residence into which the Sultan
would have put him. He said he only wanted a place
large enough to weep in, now that the people of the
Lord were in captivity.</p>

<p>The monk had entered the little gateway, and his
companion was following, when Kala's instinct for
business got the better of her reverence; and, darting
forward, she thrust the little roll into his hand just as
he was stooping to enter the gate, not even glancing at
his face. She said in low voice, not caring to be
overheard by the monk:</p>

<p>"A part of your purchase yesterday, Sire, which
you have forgotten."</p>

<p>She waited for no reply, but trotted off, muttering
to herself:</p>

<p>"That's done, now for old Ibrahim the Jew."</p>

<p>The contrast between Morsinia and the Egyptian as
they presented themselves for the contest, afforded a
capital study in racial physique. The latter was rather
under size, with scarcely more of womanly development
than a boy. Her face was almost copper colored;
her hair jet and short. The former was tall, with femininity
stamped upon the contour of bust and limb;
her face pale, even beneath the mass of her light
locks.</p>

<p>The kaiks were of thinnest wood that could be held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
together by the web-like cross bracing, and seemed
scarcely to break the surface of the water when the
odalisks stepped into them. Morsinia had brought a
feridjé of common sort; saying to the eunuch, whose
attention it attracted, that yesterday she was quite
chilled after rowing, and to day had taken this with
her by way of precaution. She might have found
something more beautiful had she thought in time;
but it would be dark when they returned. Besides,
it would be a capital brace for her feet; the crossbar
arranged for that purpose being rather too far away
from the seat. So saying she tossed it into the bottom
of the kaik before the officious eunuch could provide
a better substitute.</p>

<p>The Padishah's bugle sounded the call. It rang
over the waters, evoking echoes from the triple shore
of Stamboul, Galata and Skutari, which died away in
the distant billows of Marmora. As it was to be the
last evening before the pageant of the grand reception,
the time was occupied in making final arrangements
for the order in which the boats should move; so that
it was growing dark when the Padishah reminded the
chief marshal that they must have the race for the
Admiral's badge. Katub, a fat and indolent eunuch,
was ordered to moor his kaik, for the stake boat, as
far out toward the swift current as safety would
permit.</p>

<p>The two competitors darted to the side of Mahomet's
barge. From a long staff, just high enough above the
water to be reached by the hand, hung a tiny streamer
of silk, the broad field of which was dotted with pearls.
This was to be the possession of the fair rower who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
rounding the stake boat first, could return and
seize it.</p>

<p>The Sultan threw a kiss to the fair nymphs as a
signal for the start. Myriads of liquid pearls, surpassing
in beauty those upon the streamer, dropped from
the oar blades, and strewed the smooth surface; or
were transformed into diamonds as they sunk swirling
into the broken water. The spray rose from the
sharp prows in sheafs, golden as those of grain, in the
ruddy reflection of the western sky. Each graceful
kaik, and the more graceful form that moved it,
almost created the illusion of a single creature; some
happy denizen of another world disporting itself for
the luring of mortals in this.</p>

<p>The boats kept close company. The Egyptian was
expending her full strength, but her companion, with
longer and fewer strokes, was apparently reserving
hers. They neared the stake. The Egyptian, having
the inside, began to round it; but the Albanian kept
on, now with rapid and strong strokes. The spectators
were amazed at her tactics.</p>

<p>"She is making too wide a sweep," said the Sultan.</p>

<p>"She does not seem inclined to turn at all,"
observed the Kislar Aga.</p>

<p>"She will strike the current if she turn not soon,"
rejoined Mahomet excitedly.</p>

<p>The prow of her kaik turned off westward.</p>

<p>"She is in the stream!" cried several. "She will be
overturned!" But on sped the kaik, heading full
down the current, which, catching it like some friendly
sprite from beneath, bore it quickly out of sight
around the Seraglio Point; and on&mdash;on into a thick mist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
which was rolling up, as if sent of heaven to meet it,
from the broad expanse of the sea.</p>

<p>"An escape!" cried the Sultan. "After her every
one of you black devils!"</p>

<p>The eunuchs wasted several precious moments in
getting the command through their heads, and, even
when they started, it was evident that their muscles were
too flaccid, their spines too limp, and their wind not
full enough to overhaul the flying skiff of the Albanian.</p>

<p>"To shore! To horse!" cried the raging monarch.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later, horsemen were clattering
down the stony street along the water front of
Marmora, pausing now and then to stare out into the
sea mist, dashing on, stopping and staring, and on
again. The foremost to reach the Castle of the Seven
Towers left orders to scour the shore, and to set patrol
to prevent any one landing. Some were ordered to
dart across to the islands. Within an hour from the
escape every inch of shore, and the great water course
opposite the city, were under complete surveillance.</p>

<p>Just before this was accomplished a man arrived at
the water's edge, close to the south side of the great
wall of which the Castle of Seven Towers was the
northern flank. He held two horses, saddled and
bagged, as if for a distant journey. A second man appeared
a moment later, who came up from a clump of
bushes a little way below.</p>

<p>"In good time, Marcus!" said the new comer, who
stooped close to the water and listened, putting his
hand to his ear so as to exclude all sounds except
such as should come from the sea above.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span></p>

<p>"Listen! an oar stroke! Yes! Keep everything
tight, Marcus."</p>

<p>Darting into the copse, in a moment more the man
was gliding in a kaik, with a noiseless stroke, out in
the direction of the oar splash of the approaching
boat. Nearer and nearer it came. The night and
the mist prevented its being seen. The man moved
close to its line. It was a light kaik, he knew from
the almost noiseless ripple of the water as the sharp
prow cut it. The man gave a slight whistle, when the
stroke of the invisible boat ceased, and the ripple at
its prow died away.</p>

<p>"Morsinia!"</p>

<p>"Ay, thank heaven!" came the response.</p>

<p>"Speak not now, but follow!" and he led the way
cautiously toward the little beach where the horses
were heard stamping. They were several rods off,
piloting themselves by the sound.</p>

<p>"Hark!" said the man, stopping the boats. Hoofs
were heard approaching, and voices&mdash;</p>

<p>"She might have put across to the Princess Island,"
said one.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" was the reply. "She would only imprison
herself by that&mdash;more likely she has gone clean
across to Chalcedon. But I hold that she has played
fox, and turned on her trail. Ten liras to one that
she is by this time in Galata with some of the Genoese
Giaours. If so, she will try to escape in a galley; but
that can be prevented: for the Padishah will overhaul
every craft that sails out until he finds her. But
hoot, man! what have we here? Two horses! A
woman's baggage! She has an accomplice! An elopement!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
The horses are tied. The runaway couple
haven't arrived yet. Dismount, men! we will lie in
wait along the shore here. Yes, let their two horses
stand there to draw them to the spot by their stamping.
Send ours out of hearing. Now every man to
his place! Silence!"</p>

<p>"Back! Back! We are pursued on land," said the
man in the boat to Morsinia, and both boats pushed
noiselessly out again from the shore.</p>

<p>"I had prepared for this, Morsinia. You must
come into my boat; we will row below for a mile,
where we can arrange it at the shore."</p>

<p>Quietly they shot down in the lessening current,
until they turned into a little cove made by a projecting
rock. As lightly as a fawn the girl leaped to the
beach. Her companion was by her side in an instant.
She drew back, and gave no return to his warm embrace,
but said heartily:</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven, and you, Michael!"</p>

<p>"Michael?" exclaimed the man. "Indeed I do
not wonder that you think me a spirit, and call me by
the name of my dead brother. But this shall assure
you that I am Constantine, and in the flesh," cried he,
as he pressed a kiss upon her lips.</p>

<p>Morsinia was dazed. She tried to scan his face.
She fell as one lifeless into his arms.</p>

<p>He seated himself on the rock and held her to his
heart. For a while neither could speak.</p>

<p>"Is it real?" said she at length, raising her head
and feeling his face with her hand. "But how"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Voices were heard shouting over the water.</p>

<p>"We must be gone," said Constantine.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span></p>

<p>The excitement of her discovery that her lover was
still living, and her bewilderment at his appearance
instead of Michael, were too much for Morsinia.
Constantine carried the exhausted girl into his boat,
which was larger than hers. Towing her little kaik
out some distance he tipped it bottom upwards, and
let it drift away.</p>

<p>"That will stop the hounds," muttered he. "They
will think you have been overturned."</p>

<p>With tremendous, but scarcely audible, strokes he
ploughed away westward. It was not until far from
all noise of the pursuers that he paused.</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER XLIX.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>mminent as was the danger still, the curiosity
of both at the strangeness of the Providence
which had brought them back to each other, as from
the dead, was such that they must talk; and the
freshness of the newly-kindled love stole many a moment
for endearing embrace. Indeed an hour passed,
and the night might have flown while they loitered,
were it not that the rising wind brought a distant
sound which awakened them to the remembrance that
they were still fugitives.</p>

<p>Constantine at length insisted that his companion
should lie upon the bottom of the boat, and take
needed rest.</p>

<p>"If I had now my feridjé!" said she.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span></p>

<p>"I have provided for that," replied Constantine.
"Yours would be recognized. I have one belonging
to the common women, which will be better." In
addition to the feridjé, the foresight of Constantine
had laid in warm wraps and a store of provisions.
These were packed in bundles that they might be
carried conveniently on horses, in the hand, or in the
boat, as necessity should compel.</p>

<p>"I cannot rest," said Morsinia, "when there is so
much to say and hear."</p>

<p>"But you must lie down. I will tell you my story;
then you can tell me yours."</p>

<p>"But can we not stop?"</p>

<p>"No. It will not be safe to do so yet."</p>

<p>"I have learned to trust your guidance as well as
your love," said she, and reclined in the stern of the
boat.</p>

<p>The moon rose near to midnight. The fog illumined
by it made them clearly visible to each other,
while it shut out the possibility of their being seen by
any from a distance.</p>

<p>"It is the blessing of Jesu upon us," said Morsinia.
"The same as when He stood upon the little lake in
Galilee, like a form of light, and said, 'Be not
afraid.'"</p>

<p>Constantine gave his story in hasty sentences and
detached portions, breaking it by pauses in which he
listened for pursuers, or gave his whole strength to the
oars, or, more frequently, did nothing but gaze at his
companion: more than once reaching out his hand to
touch her, and see if she were not an apparition.</p>

<p>He told of his escape from the Turks, his arrest as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
a lunatic and the scene before the Sultan, his return
to Constantinople after its capture, and the apparent
evidence he there had from the old beggar, of Morsinia's
death: with all of which the reader is familiar.
He also related how he had gone to Albania. The
report of Morsinia's death had caused the greatest
grief to Kabilovitsch, and thrown General Castriot
into such a rage that he found easement for it in a
special raid upon the Turkish camp; which raid was
remembered, and was still spoken of by the soldiers, as
the "Call of the Maiden." For as Castriot returned
from fearful slaughter, in which he had completely
riddled the enemy's quarters, captured their commander
and compelled them to break up the campaign,
the general was overheard to say, "The maiden's
spirit called us and we have answered." Without knowing
the meaning of these words the soldiers probably
assumed that they were a reference to the Holy Virgin
Mary, whose blessing Castriot had invoked upon the
enterprise. After that Sultan Mahomet sent a special
embassage and proposal of peace to Albania. In the
royal letter he stated,</p>

<p>"She whom the Emperor of the Greeks was unable
to keep for Scanderbeg is now in the custody of the
royal harem, safe and inviolate; to be delivered into
Scanderbeg's hand as a pledge of a treaty by which
Scanderbeg shall agree to cease from further depredations
and invasion of Macedonia, and to submit to
hold his kingdom in fief to the Ottoman throne."</p>

<p>The letter ended with a boastful reference to the
Sultan's conquest of Constantinople, Caramania and
other countries, and the threat of invading Albania
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
with a host so great as to cover all its territory with
the shadow of the camps.</p>

<p>Castriot's reply, when known, filled the Dibrians and
Epirots with greatest enthusiasm. It closed with the
words,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What if you have subjugated Greece, and put into
servitude them of Asia! These are no examples for
the free hearts of Albania!"<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The news contained in Mahomet's missive led Castriot
to allow Constantine to go to Constantinople, that
he might discover, if possible, whether Morsinia was
really living, and was the person referred to by the
Sultan. On reaching the city, Constantine had sought
out the monk Gennadius, with whom he had been
often thrown before and during the siege. From him
he learned nothing of Morsinia except the old story
of her self-sacrifice by the side of the altar;&mdash;which
story had become so adorned with many additions in
passing from mouth to mouth, that the "Fair Saint of
Albania" was likely to be enrolled upon the calendar
of the holy martyrs. Constantine was returning with
the monk from the church of Baloukli, where they had
gone to see the perpetuated miracle of the fishes which
leaped from the pan on hearing of the capture of the
city, and which are still, with one side black with the
frying, swimming in the tank of holy water. He had
just reached the little gate of the monk's lodging
when Morsinia's message was put into his hand by a
little old woman.</p>

<p>"But how did you know of my arrival in Constantinople?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
Constantine asked, as he concluded his
account.</p>

<p>The question led to Morsinia's story, and the
revelation that his brother Michael was still living, an
officer of the Sultan, as like to Constantine as one
eye to the other; their mistaken identity by Kala
Hanoum having led to the present happy denouement.
The mutual narratives of the past grew into
plans for the future, the chief part of which related to
the restoration of Michael from the service of the
Moslem.</p>

<p>While they talked, the day broke over the Asiatic
coast. The faint glow of light rapidly changed into
bars of gold, which were transformed into those of
silver, and melted again into a broad sheen of orange
and purple tints. But for the shadowed slopes of the
eastern shore that lay between the water and the sky,
this would have made Marmora like an infinite sea of
glory.</p>

<p>But there was a fairer sight before the eyes of Constantine;
one more suggestive of the heavenly. It
was the face of his beloved, now first clearly seen.
It seemed to him that she could not have been more
enchanting if he had discovered her by the "River of
the Water of Life" in the Golden City, where only
he had hoped ever again to gaze upon her.
</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER L.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he fugitives landed a good score of miles from
Stamboul, on the northern shore of Marmora,
and struck the highway which runs westward, following
the coast line to Salonika, where it divides, bending
south into Greece, and branching north through
Macedonia. The fugitives followed the latter highway.
The country through which they passed was
at the time conquered by the Moslem, but was dotted
over with the settlements of the adherents to the old
faith, who kept the watchfires of hope still burning in
their hearts, though they were extinguished on the
mountains. It was by this route that Constantine had
gone to Stamboul. He was therefore familiar, not
only with the way, but with the people; and easily
secured from them concealment when necessary, and
help along the journey. His belt had been well filled
with gold by Castriot, so that two fleet horses and all
provisions were readily supplied.</p>

<p>Their journey was saddened by their solicitude for
the fate of Albania. Before Constantine had left that
country, Moses Goleme, wearied with the incessant
sacrifices he was compelled to make, and discouraged
by what he deemed the impossibility of longer holding
out against the Turks, had quarreled with Castriot,
and thrown off his allegiance. He had even been
induced by Mahomet's pledge of liberty to Albania&mdash;if
only Castriot were overthrown&mdash;to enter the service
of the enemy. The wily Sultan had placed him in
command of an invading army, with which, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
he had returned to his country only to meet an overwhelming
defeat at the hands of the great captain,
and to flee in disgrace to Constantinople.</p>

<p>This swift vengeance administered by the patriots
did not entirely crush the dissatisfaction among the
people. Their fields were wasted by the long war;
for half a generation had passed since it began. Only
the personal magnetism of their chief held the factions
to their doubtful loyalty.</p>

<p>After several weeks' journeying, our fugitives
reached the camp of Castriot. It little resembled the
gorgeous canvas cities of the Turks they had passed.
The overspreading trees were, in many instances, the
only shelter of voivodes and princely leaders, the
story of whose exploits floated as an enchantment to
the lovers of the heroic in all lands.</p>

<p>But the simple welcome they received from the
true hearts of their countrymen was more to Morsinia
and Constantine than any stately reception could
have been. Kabilovitsch's joy was boundless. The
venerable man had greatly failed, worn by outward
toil, and more by his inward grief. Castriot had
grown prematurely old. His hair was whitened; his
eyes more deeply sunken beneath the massive brows;
his shoulders a little bowed. Yet there was no sign
of decrepitude in face or limb. His aspect was
sterner, and even stronger, as if knit with the iron
threads of desperation.</p>

<p>As Kabilovitsch, whom the wanderers had first
sought upon their arrival, led them to Castriot, the
general gazed upon them silently for a little. Years,
with their strange memories, seemed to flit, one after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
another, across his scarred face. Taking Morsinia's
hands in his, he stood looking down into her blue
eyes, just as he had done when years ago, he bade her
farewell. Then he kissed her forehead as he said:</p>

<p>"Thank heaven! there is not yet a wrinkle on that
fair brow. But I wronged you, my child, in sending
you among strangers. Can you forgive the blunder
of my judgment? It was my heart that led me
wrong."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to forgive thee," replied Morsinia.
"Though I have suffered, to gaze again into thy face,
Sire, takes away even the memory of it all. I shall be
fully blessed if now I can remove some of those care
marks from thy brow."</p>

<p>"Your return takes away from me twice as many
years as those you have been absent, and I shall be
young again now&mdash;as young almost as Kabilovitsch,"
added he, with a kindly glance at the old veteran,
whose battered dignity had given place to an almost
childish delight.</p>

<p>The scene within the tent was interrupted by a
noise without. A crowd of soldiers had gathered,
and were gazing from a respectful distance at a
strange-looking man: "A man of heaviness and eaten
up with cares." He was clad in the coarsest garments;
his beard untrimmed; hatless; a rope about
his neck. As Scanderbeg came out of the tent, the
man threw himself at his feet, and cried, as he bowed
his head upon the ground:</p>

<p>"Strike, Sire! I have sold my country. I have
returned to die under the sword of my true chief,
rather than live with the blessing of his enemies. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
curse on my soul is greater than I could bear, with all
the splendid rewards of my treason. Take out the
curse with my blood! Strike, Sire! Strike!"</p>

<p>He was Moses Goleme. Castriot stood with folded
arms and looked upon the prostrate man. His lips
trembled, and then were swollen, as was noted of them
when his soul was fired with the battle rage. Then
every muscle of his face quivered as if touched by
some sharp pain. Then came a look of sorrow and
pity. His broad bosom heaved with the deep-drawn
breath as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Moses Goleme, rise! Your place is at no man's
feet. For twenty years you watched by Albania, while
I forgot my fatherland. Your name has been the rallying
cry of the patriot; your words the wisdom of
our council; your arm my strength. Brave man!
take Castriot's sword, and wear it again until your own
heart tells you that your honor has been redeemed.
Rise!"</p>

<p>Untying the rope from the miserable man's neck, he
flung it far off, and cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"So, away with whatever disgraces the noble
Goleme! My curse on him who taunts thee for the
past! Let that be as a hideous dream to be forgotten.
For well I know, brave comrade, that thy heart slept
when thou wast away. But it wakes again. Thou art
thy true self once more!"</p>

<p>The broken-hearted man replied, scarcely raising his
eyes as he spoke:</p>

<p>"My hands are not worthy to touch the sword of
Castriot. Let me cleanse them with patriot service.
Tell me, Sire, some desperate adventure, where, since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
thou wilt not slay me, I may give my wretched life
for my country."</p>

<p>"No, Moses, you shall keep your life for Albania.
I know well the strength of your temptation. My
service is too much for any man. Were it not that I
am sustained by some strange invisible spirit, I too
would have yielded long ago. But enough! The old
command awaits thee, Moses."</p>

<p>The man looked upon Castriot with grateful amazement.
But he could not speak, and turned away.</p>

<p>At first he was received sullenly by the soldiers;
but when the story of Castriot's magnanimity was
repeated, the camps rang with the cry, "Welcome,
Goleme!" That his restoration might be honored, a
grand raid through the Turkish lines was arranged
for the next night. The watch cry was, "By the beard
of Moses!" and many a veteran then wielded his
sword with a courage and strength he had not felt for
years. Even old Kabilovitsch, whose failing vigor had
long excused him from such expeditions, insisted upon
joining in this. Constantine then rewhetted his steel
for valiant deeds to come. And, as the day after the
fight dawned, Moses Goleme led back the band of victors,
laden with spoil. As he appeared, to make his
report to the chief, his face was flushed with the old
look; and, grasping the hand of Castriot, he raised
it to his lips and simply said:</p>

<p>"I thank thee, Sire!" and retired.

<h3>CHAPTER LI.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>aptain Ballaban was among the first to learn
of the personality of the odalisk who had escaped
at the time of the race. His first thought was to aid her
in eluding pursuit, presuming that she had gone alone
and without accomplice. But when the horses were
discovered at the Seven Towers, he gave way to a fit
of jealousy. In his mind he accused Morsinia of having
made him her dupe; for, notwithstanding his
assurances of aid, she had evidently made a confidant
of another. His better disposition, however, soon led
him to believe that she had been spirited away through
some plan devised in the brain of Scanderbeg. While
he rejoiced for her, he was disconsolate for himself;
and determined that, upon his return to the war in
Albania, to which field he knew it was the purpose of
the Padishah to transfer him, he would discover the
truth regarding her. He had learned from her secret
missives, which Kala Hanoum had brought him before
the flight, of the death of his father Milosch and his
mother Helena, and the supposed death of his brother
Constantine. There were, then, no ties of kinship,
and but this one tie of affection to Morsinia, to divide
his allegiance to the Padishah. And Morsinia had
faded again from reality, if not into his mere dream, at
least into the vaguest hope. His ardent soul found
relief only by plunging into the excitement of the
military service.</p>

<p>Mahomet had not exhausted his favors to Ballaban
by the gift of the Albanian Venus, Elissa. Summoning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
him one day he repeated his purpose of designating
him as the chief Aga of the Janizaries, the old chief
having been slain in a recent engagement. Ballaban
remonstrated, as once before, against this interference
with the order of the corps, in which the choice of
chief Aga was left to the vote of the soldiers themselves.</p>

<p>Mahomet replied angrily&mdash;"I tell you, Ballaban,
my will shall now be supreme over every branch of my
service. My fathers felt the independence of the Janizaries
to be a menace to their thrones. Their power
shall be curbed to my hand, or the whole order shall
be abolished."</p>

<p>"Beware!" replied Ballaban. "You know not the
alertness of the lion whose lair you would invade. I
will serve my Padishah with my life in all other ways,
but my vows forbid my treachery to my corps. Strike
off my head, if you will, but I cannot be Aga, except
by the sovereign consent of my brothers."</p>

<p>"I shall not take off your head, comrade," replied
Mahomet. "I need what is in it too much, though it
belongs to a young rebel. But begone! I shall work
my plans without asking your advice in the matter."</p>

<p>A firman was issued by which the Padishah claimed
the supreme power of appointing to command in all
grades of the military service. Within an hour after
its proclamation, the Janizaries were in open defiance
of the sovereign. Before their movements could be
anticipated, the great court in front of the selamlik in
the seraglio was filled with the enraged soldiery. That
sign of terror which had blanched the faces of former
Padishahs&mdash;the inverted soup-kettle&mdash;was planted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
before the very doors of the palace, and the Sultan
was a prisoner within.</p>

<p>"Recall the firman! Long live the Yeni-Tscheri!"
rang among the seraglio walls, and was echoed over
the city.</p>

<p>The Sultan not appearing, there rose another cry,
at first only a murmur, but at length pouring from
thousands of hoarse throats,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Down with Mahomet! Live the Yeni-Tscheri!"</p>

<p>Still the Sultan made no response. There was a
hurried consultation among the leaders of the insurgents.
Then a rapid movement throughout the crowd.
For a moment it seemed as if they had turned every
man against his fellow. But Mahomet's experienced
eye, as he watched from the latticed window, saw that
the swarm of men was only taking shape. The mob
was transformed into companies. Between the ranks
passed men, as if they rose out of the ground; some
dragging cannon; some bearing scaling ladders.</p>

<p>Mahomet appeared upon the platform, dressed in
full armor. He raised his sword, when silence fell
upon the multitude.</p>

<p>"I am your Padishah."</p>

<p>"Long live Mahomet!" was the cry.</p>

<p>"Do I not command every faithful Ottoman? Who
will follow where Mahomet leads?"</p>

<p>"All! all!" rang the response.</p>

<p>"Then reverse the kettle!" commanded he, his face
lit with the assumption of victory.</p>

<p>"Reverse the firman!" was the answer.</p>

<p>"Never!" cried the monarch, infuriated with this
unexpected challenge of his authority.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span></p>

<p>The Janizaries retreated a few steps from the
platform. The Padishah assumed that they were awed
by his determination, and smiled in his triumph. But
his face was as quickly shaded with astonishment; for
the movement of the insurgents was only to allow the
cannon to be advanced.</p>

<p>The sagacity of the monarch never forsook him.
Not even the wildness of passion could long lead him
beyond the suggestion of policy. Raising his hand
for silence, he again spoke.</p>

<p>"We are misunderstanding each other, my brave
Yeni-Tscheri. If you have grievance let your Agas
present it, for the Padishah shall be the father of his
people, and the Yeni-Tscheri are the eldest born of his
children."</p>

<p>The Sultan withdrew. Eight Agas held a hurried
consultation, and presented themselves to the sovereign
to offer him absolute and unquestioning obedience
upon the condition of their retaining as absolute
and unquestioned self-government within the
corps.</p>

<p>While they were in consultation, Captain Ballaban
appeared among the troops. He waved his hand to
address them.</p>

<p>"He is bought by the Padishah. We must not hear
him," cried one and another.</p>

<p>"My brothers!" said the Captain, having after a
few moments gained their attention. "I love the
Padishah. But I adore that royal hand chiefly because,
beyond that of any of the heirs of Othman, it has
already bestowed favor upon our corps. But our
order is sacred. He may command to the field, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
in the field, but it must be from without. We must
choose our own Aga as of old."</p>

<p>"Long live Ballaban!" rose from every side.</p>

<p>The speaker broke into a rhapsodic narration of
the glories of the corps, interwoven with the recital
of the exploits of the Padishah, during which he was
interrupted by cheer after cheer, mingled with the cry
of "Ballaban! Ballaban forever!"</p>

<p>The Sultan, hearing the shout, shrewdly seized upon
the opportunity it suggested, and leaving the Agas,
rushed to the platform. He shouted&mdash;</p>

<p>"Allah be praised! Allah has given one mind to
the Padishah and to his faithful Yeni-Tscheri. Ballaban
forever! Yes, take him! Take him for your
Aga! The will of the corps and the will of the sovereign
are one, for it is the will of Allah that sways
us all!"</p>

<p>The soldiers, caught by the enthusiasm of the
instant, repeated the shout, drowning the voices of the
few who were clear-headed enough to remember that
the firman had not been withdrawn.</p>

<p>"Ballaban! Long live Ballaban Aga! Long live
Mahomet Padishah!"</p>

<p>The Agas appeared, but were impotent to assert
their dissent. As well might they have attempted to
howl down a hurricane as to make themselves heard in
the confusion. Indeed, their presence upon the platform
was regarded by the corps as their endorsement
of the Padishah's desire, and served to stimulate the
enthusiasm that broke out in redoubled applause.</p>

<p>Mahomet followed up his advantage, and formally
confirmed the apparent election by announcing&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span></p>

<p>"A donative! A double pay to every one of the
Yeni-Tscheri! and the Padishah's fifth of the spoil
shall be divided to the host!"</p>

<p>The multitude were wild with delight. The inverted
soup-kettle was turned over, and swung by its handle
from the top of the staff; following which, the crowd
poured out from the court.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Within a few days Ballaban, as chief Aga, led his
corps toward Albania.</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER LII.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter the defeat of Moses as a Turkish leader,
and his return to his patriotic allegiance, there
was a lull in active hostilities between the two powers.
Amesa, like other of the prominent voivodes in Scanderbeg's
army, took the occasion offered to look after
his own estates. He had added somewhat to his local
importance by marrying the daughter of a neighboring
land-owner. But neither conjugal delights, nor the
additional acres his marriage brought him, covered his
ambition. His envy of Castriot had deepened into
inveterate hatred.</p>

<p>The Voivode sat alone in the great dining hall of
his castle. It was late in the night. As the blazing
logs at one end of the room cast alternately their
glare and shadows around, the rude furniture seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
to be thrown into a witching dance. Helmets and
corselets gleamed bravely from their pegs, suggesting
that they were animated by heroic souls. The great
bear-skin, with its enormous head, lying at the
Voivode's feet, crouched in readiness to receive the
lunge of the boar's tusks which threatened it from the
corner. Pikes, spears, bows and broad-mouthed
arquebuses were ranged about, as if to defend their
owner, should any demon inspire these lifeless forms
for sudden assault upon him.</p>

<p>Amesa had been sitting upon a low seat between the
fire and a half-drained tankard of home-brewed liquor,
his brows knit with the concentration of his thoughts.</p>

<p>A slight sound without arrested his attention.</p>

<p>"Drakul is late, but is coming at last. If only he
has brought me the red forelock of that fellow who
used to be always crossing my track, and has now
come back to Albania!" he said, in a tone of musing,
but intended to be heard by the delinquent as the
great oaken door creaked behind him. Raising his
eyes, but not turning his head to look, Amesa changed
his soliloquy into a volley of oaths at the comer.</p>

<p>"I thought your name-sake, Drakul, had run off
with you, you lazy imp.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> What kept you?"</p>

<p>"A long journey," was the reply.</p>

<p>Amesa started to his feet, for the voice was not that
of Drakul. He faced one whose appearance was not
the less startling because it was familiar.</p>

<p>"I have brought the red forelock myself," said the
visitor.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span></p>

<p>Amesa stared stupidly an instant, then reached
toward his weapon lying upon the table near.</p>

<p>"Stop!" said the man, laying the flat side of his
sword across the Voivode's arm before he could grasp
his yataghan.</p>

<p>"How dare you intrude yourself unbidden here!"
cried the enraged Amesa.</p>

<p>"It required no daring," was the cool reply, "for I
am the stronger."</p>

<p>"Help! Help!" shouted the voivode, as he realized
that he would not be permitted to reach his
weapon.</p>

<p>The door swung, and a band of strange men stood
in the opening.</p>

<p>"I feared, noble Amesa," said the intruder, "that I
should not be a welcome guest, and so brought with
me a party of friends to help me to good cheer while
under your roof. You need not disturb your servants
to help you, for, if they should hear, they could not
obey, as they are all safely guarded in their quarters.
If they should come out they might be harmed. Let
them rest. Retire, men! You recognize me, Lord
Amesa?"</p>

<p>"Ay. You are Arnaud's whelp," sneered the
entrapped man.</p>

<p>"More gentle words would befit the courtesy of my
host," was the quiet reply. "But you are as much
mistaken as when you took the simple witted Elissa on
my commendation. Do not respond, Sire! In your
heat you might say that which pride would prevent
your recalling. I am a Moslem soldier, and you are
my prisoner; as secure as if you were in Constantinople."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
The visitor threw off the Albanian cape, and
revealed the elegantly wrought jacket of the Janizary
Aga.</p>

<p>"And what would you have of me? Is there nothing
that can satisfy you less than my life?" asked
Amesa.</p>

<p>"My noble Amesa," said Ballaban Aga, taking a
seat and motioning the Voivode to another. "Years
ago I gave you my word in honor that I would serve
you against Scanderbeg. I have come to redeem that
pledge, and you must help me."</p>

<p>"How can that be, if you are an officer of the
Moslems?" asked Amesa, taking the seat, and adopting
the low tone of the other; for these words had
excited in him all his cupidity, and stirred his natural
secretiveness and habit of sinister dealing. His eyes
ceased to glare like a tiger's when at bay; they shone
now like a snake's.</p>

<p>"Amesa must enter the service of the Padishah."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" cried he; but in a tone that indicated,
not indignant rejection of the proposition;
rather doubt of its practicability.</p>

<p>"But first you must raise here in Albania the
standard of revolt against Scanderbeg, claiming the
title of king of Epirus and the Dibrias for yourself.
Scanderbeg's sword will, of course, compel the next
step&mdash;your safety in the Turkish camp. The Padishah
will then become your patron, offering to withdraw
his armies and restore the ancient liberties of the
country, with the solitary limitation that you shall
acknowledge the suzerainty of the Sultan. The
revenues you may collect shall remain in your possession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
for the strengthening of your local power. The
defection of Moses Goleme well nigh destroyed the
leadership of Scanderbeg&mdash;yours will complete the
work. Yet it will not be defection; rather, as Moses
Goleme regarded it, the truest service of your country,
because the only service that is practicable."</p>

<p>"But I cannot thus break with the patriot leaders,"
said Amesa, apparently having felt a real touch of honor.</p>

<p>"It must be," replied the Aga. "You cannot
longer remain as you are, even if you would. You,
Sire, have been guilty of some great crime. Nay, do
not deny it! Nor need you take time to give expression
to any wrath you may feel on being plainly
accused of it," continued Ballaban, silencing Amesa
more effectively by the straight look into his eyes than
by his words. "My moments here are too few to talk
about the matter, and you should have exhausted any
feeling you may have had in private penitence heretofore,
rather than reserve it until another person lays it
to your charge. But the point is this:&mdash;Scanderbeg is
aware of your crime, and awaits only the opportune
moment to punish you as it deserves."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" said Amesa, the bright
gleam of his eye changing to a stony stare, as the
color failed from his face, and he leaned back in
ghastly consternation.</p>

<p>"It is enough that I know it. The Janizaries have
not roamed these Albanian hills for twelve years without
finding out the secrets of the country. The holes
in the ground are our ears, and the very owls spy for
us through the dark. But enough of words. Sign
this, and set to it your seal!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span></p>

<p>Ballaban presented a parchment, offering formally,
in the name of the Sultan, the government of Albania
to Amesa, on the condition set forth above.</p>

<p>"I would consider the"&mdash;began Amesa; but he
was cut short by Ballaban&mdash;</p>

<p>"No! sign instantly! I have done for you all the
considering that is necessary, and must be gone."</p>

<p>"But," began Amesa again, "so important a matter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sign instantly!" repeated Ballaban; and, pointing
to the door where the soldiers stood waiting their
orders&mdash;"or neither Amesa nor his castle will exist
until the day breaks."</p>

<p>The baffled man took from a niche in the wall a
horn of thickened ink, and, with the wooden pen, made
his signature, and pressed the ancient seal of the De
Streeses against the ball of softened wax attached
to it.</p>

<p>"This will serve to keep you true: for if by the next
fulness of the moon Amesa's standard be not raised
against Scanderbeg's, this, as evidence of your treason,
shall be read in all your Albanian camps," said Ballaban,
placing the document in his bosom. "And should
you need to confer with your new friends, your faithful
Drakul may inquire at our lines for Ballaban Badera,
Aga of the Janizaries."</p>

<p>With a low salâm he withdrew. A few muffled
orders, a shuffling of feet, and the castle was as quiet
as the stars that looked down upon it.

<h3>CHAPTER LIII.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he martial pride of the Ottoman never made a
more imposing demonstration than when his armies
deployed upon the plain of Pharsalia<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> in Thessaly,
and threatened the southern frontier of Albania. Nor
had Jove, who, according to the mythologic conception,
held his court upon the summit of the not distant
Olympus&mdash;looked down upon such a display of earthly
power since, fifteen centuries before, the armies of
Pompey and Cæsar there contended for the domination
of the Roman world. For Mahomet II. had sworn
his mightiest oath, that, by one blow, he would now
sweep all the Arnaout rebels into the sea; and that
the waves of the Adriatic over against Italy, and those
of the Mediterranean which washed the Greek peninsula,
and the Euxine that stayed the steps of the Muscovite,
should sing with their confluent waves the
glories of the European Empire of the Ottoman which
lay between them.</p>

<p>The menace to Scanderbeg's domain was not chiefly
in the numbers of men whom the redoubtable Isaac
Pasha now commanded in the name of the Sultan;
but in the fact that the mighty host was accompanied
by Amesa, the new "King of Albania."</p>

<p>The defection of the Voivode had sent consternation
through the hearts of the patriots. Their leaders
looked with suspicion into one another's faces as they
gathered in council; for no one knew but that his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
comrade was in secret league with the enemy. Wearied
with trials, the soldiers whispered in the camps
that Amesa was a Castriot as well as Scanderbeg. Italians
of rank, who had loaned their swords to the great
chieftain, were returning to their homes, saying that it
was not worth while to risk their lives and fortunes in
defending a people who were no longer agreed in
defending themselves. Scanderbeg, apparently unwilling
or unable to cope with this double danger,&mdash;the
power of the Ottoman without, and a civil war
within his land&mdash;retired to Lyssa,<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> far away to the
north.</p>

<p>The Turks determined to inaugurate their final conquest,
by the formal coronation of their ally, so that,
heralded by King Amesa's proclamations, they might
advance more readily to the occupation of the land.
The day was set for the ceremony of the royal investiture.
As their scouts, ranging far and wide, reported
no enemy to be near, the attention of the army was
given to preparation for the splendid pageants, the
very story of which should awe the simple peasant
population into submission, or seduce their hearts with
the hope of having so magnificent a patron.</p>

<p>The day before that appointed for this glorious dawn
of the new royalty, was one of intense heat, in the
middle of July. The snows had melted even from
the summit of the Thessalian Olympus, though its
bare pinnacle yonder pierced the sky nearly ten thousand
feet above the sea. Armor was heaped in the
tents. Horses unsaddled were gathered in stockades,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
or tethered far out on the glassy plain. Soldiers
stretched themselves under the shadow of the trees, or
wandered in groups through the deserted gardens and
orchards of the neighboring country, feasting upon
the early ripened fruits. Only the eagles that circled the
air high above the vast encampment, or perched upon
the crags of distant hills, seemed to have any alarm;
for now and then they darted off with a shrill cry.</p>

<p>But an eye, like that of a mysterious retributive
Providence, was peering through the thicket that
crested a high hill. Scanderbeg, presumed to be far
away, had studied the plain long and intently; when,
turning to Constantine, who was at his side, he said:</p>

<p>"Now plan me a raid through that flock of silly
sheep. Where would you strike, my boy?"</p>

<p>Constantine replied, "There is but one point at
which we could enter the plain,&mdash;through yonder
depression. The hills on either side would conceal
the advance until well upon them. Besides, the narrowness
of the valley, and the growth of trees would
prevent their meeting us with more than man for
man."</p>

<p>Scanderbeg shook his head.</p>

<p>"The Turks know that place invites attack as well
as we do, and have ranged so as to prevent surprise
there. But yonder line of trees and copse leads
almost to the centre of their camp."</p>

<p>"But it is exposed to view on either side," replied
Constantine.</p>

<p>"So much the better," said Castriot, "and therefore
it is not guarded even in Isaac Pasha's thought.
It would take longer after the alarm to range
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
against us there than in the ravine. Their cavalry is
all on this side the trees. They could not cut through
the bushes before we were by the horse-tails yonder,
there by the Pasha's tent."</p>

<p>"But is it not too open?" said Constantine, almost
incredulous.</p>

<p>"Yes, at any other time than this, when the Turks
are not dreaming of our being within a dozen leagues
of them. The very boldness of such an attack as this
at high noon-tide will be better for us than any scheming.
And, if I mistake not, and our beasts are not too
jaded by the long march, we shall have the souls out
of a thousand or so of the Turks before they can get
their bodies into armor. And I give to you, my boy,
the care of our nephew, Amesa. Be diverted by no
side play, but cut your way straight to him. If possible,
spare his life, but he must never get a crown upon
his head."</p>

<p>As silently as the summer's fleecy clouds gather
into the storm, the band of patriots, summoned from
their various quarters, gathered behind the spur of the
hill. The Turks were startled as with a sudden rising
tempest. Beys and Pashas and Agas had scarcely
emerged from their tents, when five thousand Albanian
cavalrymen were already turning the line of the woods.
On they came with the celerity of a flock of birds just
skimming the ground. The sentry flew as the leaves
before the wind. The very multitude of the Turks,
driven toward the centre, but fed the dripping swords
of the assailants. Among the tents wound the compact
array of Albanian riders, like a huge serpent.
On and on it rolled, scarcely pausing to repel attack.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
Dividing, one part crushed the headquarters of Isaac,
while the other wrapped in its crunching folds the
splendid camp of Amesa.</p>

<p>Bravely did this young Absalom defend his unfledged
royalty. Surrounded by a group of Albanian
renegades like himself, he fought desperately,
well knowing the dire vengeance which should follow
his capture. But one by one they fell. Amesa
remained almost alone, as yet unharmed. The captain
of the Albanian troops commanded a halt, and, dismounting,
he demanded Amesa's surrender.</p>

<p>"To none but a Castriot will a Castriot surrender!"
cried the infuriate man, making a lunge at the challenger.
The thrust was avoided.</p>

<p>"You shall surrender to another," cried the Albanian
officer. "Stand back, men, he shall yield to me
alone."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" growled the challenged man.</p>

<p>"One who has the right to avenge the wrong done
to Mara de Streeses," was the reply.</p>

<p>Quick as a panther Amesa leaped upon him. But
the tremendous blow he aimed, might as well have
been delivered against a rock, as against the sword of
Constantine. The effort threw him off his balance;
and before he could recover himself, the tremendous
slash of his opponent, though warded, brought him to
the ground. In an instant Constantine's knee was
upon his breast, and his sword at his throat.</p>

<p>"Do you surrender?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" groaned the helpless man.</p>

<p>He was instantly disarmed, and bound by the girth
to a horse.

<h3>CHAPTER LIV.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he corps of Janizaries had been quartered at
some distance from the main body of the Turks.
Their new Aga comprehended at once the significance
of the turmoil in the camp, and hastened to the
defence. Though he moved rapidly, and with a well
conceived plan of confronting the enemy, yet, most of
his troops being foot-soldiers, he was unable to confront
the swift-riding squadrons of Scanderbeg.
These assailants withdrew from the field, but only to
return again and again upon the panic stricken Turks,
whose fears had magnified the numbers of their foes
into scores of thousands. So rapidly did assault follow
assault, and from such diverse quarters, that the
Moslem fright imagined one attack was headed by the
terrible Ivan Beg with his savage Montenegrins, and
another by Hunyades, a report of whose alliance
with Scanderbeg had reached the camps before the
battle. Indeed the rumble of a coming thunder
storm was interpreted into the clamor and tread of
unknown myriads ready to burst through the mountains.
Never did a more insane panic steal away the
courage of soldiers and the judgment of generals.
Late in the day the plain of Pharsalia was the scene
of one vast wreck. Overturned tents displayed
immense stores of burnished arms and vestments, provisions
of need and luxury, standards for the field
and banners for the pageant; and everywhere strewn
amid this debris of pomp and pride the half-armored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
bodies of the slaughtered Turks. In narrow mountain
valleys the freshet following the sudden tempest,
never changed the bloom of the summer gardens
more completely, than this panic, following Scanderbeg's
raid, changed the splendid camp of the morning
into the desolation upon which the setting sun
cast, as a fitting omen, its red rays. Indeed, we can
conceive no similitude by which to express the contrast
better than that of Amesa himself, in the morning
adorned in the splendor of his royal expectation,
and at night lying bound with ropes at the feet of
Scanderbeg.</p>

<p>The grand old chieftain looked at the renegade for
a moment with pity and scorn; then turned away,
saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let him lie there until Captain Constantine, to
whom he belongs, shall come."</p>

<p>But Constantine came not. Though the main
body of the Turks had taken to precipitate flight, the
Janizaries had managed, by their unbroken and
orderly retreat, to cover the rear, and prevent pursuit
by Scanderbeg. Ballaban had reached the group
engaged in the capture of Amesa, and almost rescued
him. This would have been accomplished had not
Constantine and a handful of his company made a
living wall between the Janizaries and those who were
leading away the miserable man. Ballaban, feeling
the responsibility of saving him whom he had led into
this shameful misfortune, pressed to the very
front.</p>

<p>"By the sword of the Prophet! the fellow fights
bravely," he exclaimed, as he watched Constantine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
baffling a half dozen Janizaries who were pressing
upon him.</p>

<p>"Back, men! I would measure my arm against
his," he cried, as he laid his sword against that of his
unknown antagonist.</p>

<p>Both were in complete armor, their faces concealed
by the closed helmets. The soldiers stood as eager
spectators of the masterly sword play. The two men
seemed evenly matched,&mdash;the same in stature and
build. There was, too, a surprising similarity in
movement&mdash;the very tactics of the Janizary in thrust
and parry being repeated by the Albanian; their
swords now flashing like interlacing flames; the
sharp ring as the Albanian smote upon the polished
metal of his antagonist's armor, answered by the
duller thud as the Janizary's blow fell upon the thick
leather which encased the panoply of his opponent.
Then both stood as if posing for the sculptor; their
sword points crossing; their eyes glaring beneath the
visors; the slightest movement of a muscle anticipated
by either&mdash;then again the crash.</p>

<p>But Constantine was exhausted by his previous
engagement with Amesa. In an unlucky moment the
sword turned in his hand. The steadiness of the
grip was lost. He managed to ward the blow which
the Aga delivered; but, foreseeing that he could not
recover his grasp soon enough to return it, and that
his opponent was thrown slightly off his perfect
poise by his exertion, he dropped his sword, and
closed with him. They fell to the ground; but the
Aga, more alert at the instant, was uppermost, and
his dagger first in position for the fatal cut.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span></p>

<p>"I can not slay so valiant a man as you," said Ballaban.
"You surrender?"</p>

<p>"I must," was the response. As they rose, Ballaban
looked a moment upon the vanquished, and said,</p>

<p>"I would know the name of my worthy antagonist,
for worthier I never found. Scanderbeg himself could
not have done better. But I had the advantage of being
in better wind at the start, or, Allah knows, I had fared
hard."</p>

<p>"It is enough that I am your prisoner," said Constantine,
"and that I have detained my conqueror
long enough to prevent the recapture of that Albanian
traitor, Amesa. You can have me willingly, now that
you cannot have him."</p>

<p>The Albanian threw up his visor. Ballaban stared
at the face. It was as familiar as his own which he
saw daily in the polished brass mirror. The Janizaries
stared with almost equal amazement.</p>

<p>"No wonder he fought so well, Aga!" said one, "for
he is thy other self."</p>

<p>"Let him be brought to our headquarters when we
halt," said Ballaban, remounting his horse, and dashing
away to another part of the field.

<h3>CHAPTER LV.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">N</span>ight brought little sleep to the Turkish host.
Though danger was past, a sense of humiliation
and chagrin was shared by officers and men, as they
realized that their defeat was due to their own folly
more than to the strength of their foe. In every tentless
group the men disturbed the quiet of the night with
their ceaseless quarrels. Members of the different commands,
hopelessly confused in the general flight, rivalled
one another in the rancor and contempt of their
mutual recriminations as much as they ever emulated
one another in the courage and prowess of a well
fought field. Among those of highest rank bitter and
insulting words were followed by blows, as if the general
disgrace could be washed out by a gratuitous spilling
of their own blood.</p>

<p>But a different interest kept Ballaban waking.
Beneath the great tree, which had been designated as
the headquarters of the Janizaries, and from a limb of
which was suspended the symbolic kettle, his prisoner
had been awaiting the Chief Aga. The glimpse of his
face at the time of the capture had awakened in the
Janizary more than a suspicion of the personality of
the captive; while the name of Ballaban, which he had
heard from the soldiers, revealed to the Albanian
that of his captor. With impatience the Aga conversed
with the various commanders who thronged
him, and as soon as possible dismissed them. When
they were alone Constantine rose, and, without completing
his salâm, exclaimed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span></p>

<p>"You play more roughly, Michael, than when last
we wrestled together among the rocks of Slatiza."</p>

<p>"Ah, my brother Constantine, I thought of you
when you gripped me in the fight to-day; for it was
the same old hug with which we rolled together long
ago. I would have known you, had you only given
me time to think, without your raising the visor."</p>

<p>The brothers stood for a moment in half embrace,
scanning each other's face and form. An onlooker
would have noted that their mutual resemblance was
not in the details of their features, so much as in certain
marked peculiarities; such as the red and bristling
hair, square face, prominent nose and chin. Constantine's
forehead was higher than Michael's, which
had more breadth and massiveness across the brows.
In speaking, Constantine's eye kindled, and his plastic
lips gave expression to every play of sentiment:
while Michael's face was as inflexible as a mask; the
deep light of his glance as thoroughly under control
of his will as if it were the flash of a dark lantern; his
appearance revealing not the shadow of a thought,
not the flicker of an emotion, beyond that he chose to
put into words. This physiognomical difference was
doubtless largely due to the training of years. The
Janizary's habit of caution and secretiveness evolved,
as it were, this invisible, but impenetrable, visor. The
custom of unquestioning obedience to another, and
that of the remorseless prosecution of whatever he
regarded as politic for the service, gave rigidity to the
facial muscles; set them with the prevalent purpose;
stereotyped in them the expression of determination.
A short beard added to the immobile cast of his countenance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
Thus, though when separated the two men
might readily be taken the one for the other, when
together their resemblance served to suggest as wide
contrasts.</p>

<p>The entire night was spent by the brothers in mutual
narrations of their eventful lives. Though their
careers had been so distinct, in different lands, under
rival civilizations, in the service of contending nations,
and inflamed by the incentives of antagonistic religions,
yet their roads had crossed at the most important
points in each. They learned to their astonishment
that the most significant events, those awakening the
deepest experience in the one life, had been due to
the presence of the other. As Michael told of his
raid upon the Albanian village, Constantine supplied
the key to the mystery of the escape of his fair captive,
and the arrest of Michael for having at that time
deserted his command. Then Michael in turn supplied
the key to Constantine's arrest by Colonel Kabilovitsch's
men as a Turkish spy. Constantine solved
the enigma of Amesa's overtures to Michael in reference
to the Dodola Elissa; and Michael solved that
of Constantine's rough handling by the garrison of
Sfetigrade for having dropped the dog into the well.
Constantine unravelled the diabolical plot which had
nearly been tragic for Michael in the old reservoir at
Constantinople; and Michael as readily unravelled that
of the serio-comic drama in the tent of Mahomet,
when Constantine's life was saved through the assumption
that he was his lunatic brother. Constantine
supplied to Michael the missing link in the story of
Morsinia's escape from Constantinople; and Michael
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
supplied that which was wanting of Constantine's
knowledge of the story of her escape from death in
the horrors of the scene in St. Sophia after the capture
of the city. They had, under the strange leadings
of what both their Christian and Moslem faith recognized
as a Divine Providence, been more to each other
than they could have been had their lives drifted in
the same channel during all these years. In the old
boyhood confidence, which their strange meeting had
revived, Michael did not withhold the confession of
Morsinia's influence upon him, though she had been
to him more of an ideal than a real person, a beautiful
development to his imagination out of his childhood
memory of his little playmate in the Balkans.
Nor did Constantine hesitate to declare the love and
betrothal by which he held the charming reality as his
own. He told, too, of her real personality as the
ward of Scanderbeg, and the true heir of the splendid
estates until recently held by Amesa.</p>

<p>The dawn brought duties to the Aga which precluded
further conference with Constantine.</p>

<p>"We must part, my dear brother," said Michael.
"Our armies will probably return through Macedonia,
and abandon the campaign: for such is the unwise
determination of our commander Isaac. You must
escape into your own lines. That can be easily
arranged. We may not meet again soon; but I swear
to you, by the memory of our childhood, that your
personal interest shall be mine. Aside from the necessities
of the military service, we can be brothers still.
And Morsinia, that angel of our better natures; you
must let me share with you, if not her affection, surely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
her confidence. I could not woo her from you if I
would; but assure her that, though wearing the uniform
of an enemy, I shall be as true in my thoughts of
her as when we played by the old cot on the mountains;
and as when I pledged my life to serve her
while she was in the harem at Stamboul."</p>

<p>"But why must this war against Castriot continue?
I would that our compact were that of the armies to
which we belong," said Constantine.</p>

<p>"It is impossible for a Janizary to sheath the
sword while Scanderbeg lives," replied the Aga.
"Our oath forbids it. He once was held by the vow
of the Prophet's service, and deserted it. I know his
temptation was strong. In my heart I might find
charity for him." The speaker hesitated as if haunted
by some troublesome memory, then continued&mdash;"But
a Janizary may show no charity to a renegade. Besides,
he is the curse of Albania. But for his ambition,
these twelve years of blood would have been
those of peace and happiness through all these valleys,
under the sway of our munificent and wise Padishah."</p>

<p>"Your own best thoughts, Michael, should correct
you. What are peace and its happy indolence compared
with the cause of a holy faith?"</p>

<p>"You speak sublimely, my brother," replied Michael,
"but your faith gains nothing by this war. Under our
Padishah's beneficence the Giaours are protected.
The Greeks hold sufficient churches, even in Stamboul,
for the worship of all who remain in that faith.
Indeed, I have heard Gennadius the monk of whom
you were speaking awhile ago&mdash;say that he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
trust his flock to the keeping of the Moslem stranger
sooner than to the Pope of Rome. I have known our
Padishah defend the Greek Giaours from the tyranny
of their own bishops. He asks only the loyalty of his
people to his throne, and awaits the will of Allah to
turn them to his faith; for the Book of the Prophet
says truly, Allah will lead into error whom he pleaseth
and whom he pleaseth he will put in the right
way.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Believe me, my brother, Albania's safety is
only in submission. The Fate that directs all
affairs has indubitably decreed that all this vast
peninsula between Adria and Ægea shall lie
beneath the shadow of the Padishah's sceptre; for he
is Zil-Ullah, the shadow of God. Who can resist the
conqueror of the capital of your Eastern Christian
Empire; the conqueror of Athens, and of the islands
of the sea?"</p>

<p>"Let us then speak no more of this," said Constantine.
"Our training has been so different, that we can
not hope to agree. But we can be one in the kindliness
of our thoughts, as we are of one blood. Jesu
bless you, my brother!"</p>

<p>"Allah bless you, Constantine!" was the hearty
response, as the two grasped hands. Eyes which
would not have shown bodily pain by so much as the
tremor of their lids, were moist with the outflow of
those springs in our nature that are deeper than courage&mdash;springs
of brotherly affection, fed by hallowed
memories of the long ago.</p>

<p>Two Janizaries accompanied Constantine beyond
the Turkish lines.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span></p>

<p>"What new scheme has the Aga hatched in his
brain now?" said one of them, as they returned.</p>

<p>"He has twisted that fellow's brain so that he will
never serve Scanderbeg truly again," was the knowing
reply. "The Aga is the very devil to throw a spell
over a man. They say that when he captured the fellow
yesterday, he had only to squint into his face a
moment, when, as quick as a turn of a foil, the man
changed his looks, and was as much like the Aga as
two thumbs."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LVI.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he splendor of the victory, and the inestimable
spoil which fell into the hands of the Albanians,
elated the patriot braves; and the good news flew as
if the eagles that watched the battles from afar were
its couriers. Castriot, however, seemed to be oblivious
to the general rejoicing. The wrath he had displayed
during the time of Amesa's menace from the
ranks of the enemy, was displaced by pity as he looked
upon the contemptible and impotent man. He touched
him with his foot, and said, in half soliloquy&mdash;</p>

<p>"And in this body is some of the blood of the Castriots!
Humph!"</p>

<p>Turning away he paced the tent&mdash;</p>

<p>"And why not Castriot's blood in Amesa! It is not
too immaculate to flow in his veins, since it has filled
my own. I was a Turk, too, once. But&mdash;&mdash;" looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
at the wrinkles upon his hand&mdash;"growing old in a
better service may atone somewhat for the shame of
earlier days. And these hands never murdered a
peaceful neighbor and his innocent wife, and robbed
a child of her inheritance&mdash;though they did murder
that poor Reis-Effendi. But God knows it could not
be helped. But what is one man that he shall condemn
another!" An officer approached for orders.</p>

<p>"What, Sire, shall be done with the prisoner?"</p>

<p>"Let him lie until Constantine comes!" was the
response.</p>

<p>Late in the night the general sat gazing upon the
miserable heap of humanity that crouched by the tent
side. Amesa raised himself as far as his bonds would
permit, and began to speak.</p>

<p>"Silence!" demanded Castriot, but without taking
his eyes from the prisoner.</p>

<p>A subaltern, anxious to induce the general to take
needed rest, again suggested some disposition of the
prisoner for the night.</p>

<p>"Let him lie until Constantine comes!"</p>

<p>"Captain Constantine has been captured, Sire,"
replied the officer; "men who were with him have
returned, and so report."</p>

<p>"By whom captured?" asked the general in alarm.</p>

<p>"By Janizaries."</p>

<p>Castriot smiled, and asked, "It is certain he was not
slain?"</p>

<p>"Certain, Sire, for Ino saw him being taken away."</p>

<p>"Let the prisoner lie there until Captain Constantine
returns."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span></p>

<p>The morning found Amesa still bound. No one
had been allowed to speak to him, nor he to utter a
word.</p>

<p>During Castriot's absence from the tent not one
approached it; only the guard patrolled at the distance
of a couple of rods.</p>

<p>"The torture of such a villain's thoughts will be
more cruel than our taunts or swords. Let him lie
there, and tear himself with his own devil claws!"
had been Castriot's order.</p>

<p>Toward noon the camp rang with cheers. Scouts
reported that Constantine had escaped, and was returning.
Castriot alone seemed unsurprised, though
gratified with the news. He went to the edge of the
camp to meet him.</p>

<p>"Well, my boy, your brother was not so well pleased
with your looks, and let you go sooner than I thought
he would. I expected you not until to-night."</p>

<p>"My brother? How knew you, Sire, that I had
seen him? for I have told it to none."</p>

<p>"Then tell it to none. To warn you of that I came
to meet you, lest your tongue might be unwise. Did
you not tell me yourself that Ballaban was the Moslem
name of your brother?"</p>

<p>"But how knew you that he was in this service?"
asked Constantine.</p>

<p>"As I know every officer in the enemy's service in
Albania above an ojak's command. And the Aga of
the Janizaries is to my mind as the commander of the
expedition. And I will tell you more, my boy;&mdash;unless
the Padishah has gone daft with his chagrin
over this defeat, Ballaban Aga will command the next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
campaign against us: for none save he kept his wits
in the fight yesterday. His plan was masterful, and
saved the whole Moslem army. He held his Janizaries
so well in hand, and so well placed, that I could
not follow up our advantage, nor even strike to rescue
you. Ballaban evidently has been much in the
Albanian wars, and has learned my methods better
than any of our own officers. Should he succeed to
the horse-tails, the war hereafter will not be so one-sided
as it has been. Mark that, my dear fellow.
But we must look to our royal prisoner, after I have
heard your story."</p>

<p>Late in the day Castriot summoned Moses Goleme,
Kabilovitsch, and Constantine. Amesa was unbound,
and was bidden to speak what he could in extenuation
of his treason. The Voivode protested his innocence
of any designs against the liberties of his country;
and declared that he had despaired of obtaining her
independence under Castriot's leadership. Better was
it to take the virtual freedom of Albania under the Sultan's
nominal suzerainty, than to longer wage a hopeless
war. In this he was seconded, he said, by the noblest
generals and patriots. He was about to mention
them; but was forbidden to utter so much as a suspicion
against any one.</p>

<p>"I would not know them," said the magnanimous
chief. "I will not have a shadow of distrust in my
mind toward any who have not drawn sword against
us. Let them keep their thoughts in their own breasts.
Noble Moses, your lips shall pronounce the sentence
due Amesa's treason."</p>

<p>The Dibrian general was silent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, if Moses speaks no condemnation, no other
lips shall," said Castriot.</p>

<p>Amesa threw himself at the feet of the chief, and
began to pour forth his gratitude.</p>

<p>"The life thou hast spared, Sire, shall ever be thine.
My sword shall be given to thee as sovereign of my
heart, as well as of my country."</p>

<p>"Hold!" said Castriot. "What says Arnaud, the
forester?"</p>

<p>Amesa raised his face, blanched as suddenly with
horror as it had been flushed with elation. The venerable
Kabilovitsch sat in silence for a time, lost in
the vividness of his recollections. At length, with
slow speech and tremulous voice, he portrayed the
scenes of that terrible night when the castle of the
gallant De Streeses was destroyed, its owner slain, the
fair Mara driven back into the flames from which she
would have fled.</p>

<p>"It is a lie," shouted Amesa. "The deed was
wrought by Turks!"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thy words condemn thee!" said Castriot. "The
crime was not laid to thy charge, Amesa. But now it
shall be. Let Drakul be brought."</p>

<p>Soldiers led in the man. The villain, whose hand
had stayed at no deed of daring or cruelty, was now
seized with such cowardly fright that he could scarce
keep his legs. He was dragged before the extemporized
court. In answer to questions, he admitted
his part, not only in the original murders, but also in
the raid upon the hamlet where Amesa had suspected
the heiress of De Streeses to be concealed.</p>

<p>Amesa's rage at this betrayal burst forth in savage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
oaths, mingled with such contradictory denials of his
story as clearly confirmed its truth.</p>

<p>"For his treason against my authority, I refuse to
take vengeance," said Castriot. "But Albania, appealing
for God's aid in establishing its liberties, must, in
God's name, do justice. What says Colonel Kabilovitsch?"</p>

<p>The old man spoke as if the solemnity of the Last
Judgment had fallen upon him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"As soon I must go before Him whose mercy I
shall so sadly need for the sins of my own life, I forgive
Amesa the cruelty with which he has followed me.
God is my witness, that my personal grievance colors
not a thought of my heart. But, as I shall soon stand
before the Judge, together with the noble De Streeses,
who was robbed of life in its meridian, and that
bright spirit whose cry for Amesa's mercy I heard
from out the flames, I say, Let justice be done! and
let the soul of the murderer be sent to confront his
victims there before their God!"</p>

<p>"Amen!" said Constantine. Moses Goleme was
silent.</p>

<p>Amesa had lost all his bravado. He trembled as
would the meanest of men who should bow his neck
to the sword. He confessed his crime, and piteously
begged for his life; or, at least, that time should be
given him to make preparation for what he dreaded
worse than death. A spirit already damned seemed
to have taken possession of his quivering frame.</p>

<p>"Your life, Amesa," said the chief, "is forfeit for
your crimes. On the citadel walls of Croia, when we
shall have returned there, as the sun sets, so shall your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
life! Jesu grant that, through your repentance and
the prayers of Mother Church, your soul may rise
again in a better world!"</p>

<p>"Amen!" responded all.</p>

<p>The army returned from the Thessalian border
through the country northward, everywhere received
with ovations by the people. The fate of Amesa,
though commiserated, was as generally commended.
No one, however attached by association to the once
popular Voivode, raised a voice in dissent from the
sentence, or in pity for the culprit.</p>

<hr class="l15 p4" />
<h3>CHAPTER LVII.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he news reached Morsinia at Croia long before
the return of the army. She took little joy in the
hearty and generous acclaim that welcomed her to her
inheritance. She had no vanity to be stimulated by
the popular stories which associated her beauty with
her wealth. Her thoughts seemed to be palled with
heaviness, rather than canopied by the bright prospects
which fortune had spread for her.</p>

<p>When Castriot officially announced to her the restoration
of the DeStreeses' property, she refused to
enter upon her estates, which were to come to her
through the ceremony of blood in the execution of
her enemy.</p>

<p>"No! Let them be confiscate to the State. I
cheerfully surrender their revenues for Albania. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
ask nothing more than to be the instrument of so aiding
our noble cause and its noble leader," said she.</p>

<p>"Albania will insist that you shall obtain your
right. From voivode to lowest peasant, the people
will be content only as the daughter of DeStreeses
graces his ancient castle."</p>

<p>"But," responded she, "I shall never enter its
doors over the body of my enemy. May not some
other fate be his?"</p>

<p>"Law should be sacred," said Castriot.</p>

<p>"But is it not a law of Albania that even a murderer
need not be executed if all the family of his victim
unite in his behalf, and he pay the Krwnina?<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
Am I not all the family of DeStreeses? Let then the
estates be the Krwnina."</p>

<p>"That cannot be," replied Castriot. "The law
requires the price of blood to be paid by the murderer,
and the estates belong not to Amesa. Besides, Albania
will be better served by your occupation of the
castle, reviving its ancient prestige, and proclaiming
thus that the reign of justice has been restored in our
land."</p>

<p>"But let justice be mingled with mercy," said Morsinia.</p>

<p>"Nay, the mercy would dilute the quality of the
justice."</p>

<p>"Can there be no mitigation of our cousin Amesa's
fate, which shall not prejudice the right?" asked the
fair intercessor. "If Jesu prayed to his Father that

His murderers might be forgiven, may not I plead
that my father, the father of his country, shall be
gracious to him who has wronged me?"</p>

<p>Castriot was absorbed in deep thought. At length
he replied:</p>

<p>"Ah, how little we men, schooled to revenge and
bloodshed, know what justice is, and what mercy is,
as these sentiments move in the heart of the Eternal!
Your pure soul, my child, has closer kinship with
heaven than ours. I fear to deny your request, lest I
should offend that mysterious Spirit which has seemed
to counsel me since, in the land of the Moslems, I
swore to return to my Christian faith; and which, in
my prayers and dreams, has been strangely associated
with you. In all that is right and good your conscience
shall still inspire mine: for you are my good
angel. Amesa's life shall be spared. But no breath
of his must so much as taint the air of Albania. I am
summoned by my old ally, Ferdinand of Naples, to
assist in driving the French from his domains. Amesa
shall go with me, and be kept in custody among
strangers. But it must be proclaimed from the citadel
of Croia that his life is restored him by the daughter
of Musache de Streeses.</p>

<p>"And yet, my dear child," continued he, "in these
rude times you cannot dwell alone in the castle. You
need a protector who is not only wise and brave, and
loyal to Albania, but loyal to you. My duties elsewhere
will prevent my rendering that service. Colonel
Kabilovitsch's age is stealing the alertness from his
energies. Our Constantine&mdash;Ah! Does the blush tell
that I am right?" He took her hand, as he asked:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
"May I exercise the father's privilege, according to
our Albanian custom, and put this hand into Constantine's,
to keep and to defend?"</p>

<p>Morsinia replied frankly. "Since, Sire, I may not
give my estates to my country, bestow them upon
whom you will; and my hand must go to him, who,
since we were children, has held my heart."</p>

<p>The following day, as the sun gilded the walls of
Croia with his setting rays, an immense concourse of
soldiers and peasants gathered within the citadel
court. The executioner led the traitor, followed by a
priest, out upon the bastion. A trumpet sounded,
and the silence which followed its dying note was
broken by the voice of the crier, who announced that, in
the name of God and the sovereign people, and by the
ordaining of George, Duke of Albania, the decree of
justice should be executed upon the Voivode Amesa.
Then followed the record of his crimes, together with
the declaration that his appearance in arms among the
enemy, having been, according to his declaration, not
treason against his country, but rebellion against the
military chieftaincy of Duke George, was by the grace of
that high official forgiven; and further that the sentence
of death for his foul murder of Musache De Streeses
and his wife Mara Cernoviche, was, through the intercession
of Mara, sole survivor of that ancient house,
and by the authority of Duke George, commuted to
perpetual banishment from the realm, in such place
and condition as seemed best to the Duke for the
security of the land.</p>

<p>The people stood in amazement as they listened.
The relief from the horror of the anticipated spectacle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
when the head of the former favorite should be held
up by the executioner, led them to accept complacently
this turn in affairs, even though their judgment
did not commend it. In a few moments the cry
rose, "Live Duke George! A Castriot forever!"
Soon it changed to wilder enthusiasm, "Long live
Mara De Streeses!" This storm of applause could
not be stilled until Morsinia permitted herself to be
led by Castriot to the edge of the battlement.</p>

<p>As the sun was setting, the huge mass of the citadel
rose like a mighty altar from the bosom of the gloom
which had already settled about its base. Slowly the
shadow had climbed its side, crowding the last
bright ray until it vanished from the top of the
parapet. It was at this instant that Morsinia
appeared. The citadel beneath her was sombre as the
coming night which enwrapped it, but her form was
radiant in the lingering splendor of the departing day.
As she raised her hand in response to the grateful
clamor of the people, she seemed the impersonation
of a heavenly benediction. The multitude gazed in
reverent silence for a moment. Then, as the sun
dropped behind the western hill, veiling the glory of
this apparition, they made the very sky resound with
their shouts; and in the quick gathering darkness
went their ways.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, the castle of De Streeses was
decked with banners, whose bright colors rivalled the
late autumnal hues of the forest from the midst of
which it rose. Multitudes of people all day long
thronged the paths leading up to it from the valleys
around. Gorgeously arrayed voivodes, accompanied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
by their suites, made the ravines resound with their
rattling armor; and bands of peasants, in cheap but
gaudy finery, threaded through the by paths. Those
who possessed tents brought them. Others, upon their
arrival in the proximity of the castle, erected booths
and festooned them with vines, which the advancing
season had painted fiery red or burst into gray feathery
plumes. From cleared places near the castle walls rose
huge spirals of smoke, as oxen and sheep, quartered
or entire, were being roasted, to feed the multitude of
guests; while great casks of foaming beer and ruddy
sparkling wine excited and slaked their thirst. The
recent defeat of the Turks had led to the withdrawal
of their armies, at least until winter should have
passed; and the people of the northern country gave
themselves up to the double celebration of the well-won
peace and the nuptials of Mara De Streeses.</p>

<p>Within the castle the great and the dignified of the
land abandoned themselves to equal freedom with
the peasants, in the enjoyment of games, and the observance
of simple and fantastic national customs. Morsinia
and Constantine kissed again through the ivy
wreath, as in the days of childhood. The new matron's
distaff touched the oaken walls of the great dining
hall; and her hand spread the table with bread and
wine and water, in formal assumption of her office as
housewife. When she undressed and dressed again
the babe, borrowed from a neighboring cottage, she
received sundry scoldings and many saws of nursery
advice from a group of peasant mothers. The
happy couple were almost buried beneath the buckets
of grain, which some of the guests poured over them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
as they wished them all the blessings of the soil.
When they approached the fire place they were showered
with sparks, as some one struck the huge glowing
log and invoked for them the possession of herds and
flocks and friends as many as the fireflecks that flew.</p>

<p>Gifts were offered: those of the poor and rich
being received with equal grace;&mdash;a rare breed of
domestic fowls following a case of cutlery from
Toledo in Spain; and a necklace of pearls preceding
a hound trained by some skillful hunter. On
opening the casket which Castriot presented, as he
kissed the golden cluster upon the forehead of the
bride, there was found within a cap of sparkling
gems, such as is worn by oriental brides, a parchment
commissioning Constantine as a voivode in the
Albanian service, with governor's command of the
Skadar country.</p>

<p>The blessing of the priest was supplemented by
those of the old men, which were put in form of
prophecies. Kabilovitsch inclosed the happy couple
in outstretched arms, and gazing long into their faces,
said:</p>

<p>"As on that night at the foot of the Balkans I
wrapped you, my children, in my blanket, and, in my
absence, another greater than we knew, our generous
Castriot, took my place to watch over you; so now, as
soon I must leave you forever, One greater than
man knows, even our Covenant God, shall be your
guardian!"</p>

<p>A man, apparently decrepit with the weight of years,
assumed the privilege of a venerable stranger upon such
occasions, and came to utter his prophecy. His head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
was covered with a close fitting fur cap, which concealed
his brow to the eyes. Straggling gray locks hung
partly over his face and down his neck. As he spoke,
Constantine started with evident amazement, which
was, however, instantly checked. The bride seemed
strangely fascinated. Kabilovitsch, who had been too
much absorbed with his own thoughts to notice the
stranger's approach, lifted his head quickly, and put
his hand to his ear, as if catching some faint and
distant sound. This was the old prophet's blessing&mdash;</p>

<p>"Allah ordains that these walls, consecrated to
Justice, and inhabited by Love, shall from this day be
guarded by Peace. Even the Moslem's sword shall be
stayed from hence!"</p>

<p>He bowed to the floor, touching with his lips the
spot where Morsinia had stood. Before the guests
could fully comprehend this scene, he was gone. But
lying on the floor where he had bowed was a silken
case, elegantly wrought. Morsinia uttered a subdued,
yet startled, cry as she seized it. The gift seemed to
have thrown a spell about her; for, with paled cheeks,
she asked that she might retire to rest awhile in her
chamber.</p>

<p>"A wjeshtize!" cried several, looking out from
the door through which the man had passed.</p>

<p>"Heaven grant he has left no curse!" exclaimed
others.</p>

<p>The silken case contained several crystals of atar
of roses. In one of these, which was larger than the
others, gleamed, instead of the perfumed drop, a
splendid diamond. Upon a piece of parchment, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
fine as the silk of which the case was made, Morsinia
read&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"My pledge to give my life for thine shall be kept
when need requires&mdash;Meanwhile know that the
Padishah, the rightful Lord of Albania, has bestowed
this castle upon Ballaban Badera, Aga of the Janizaries,
who in turn bestows it upon Mara De Streeses&mdash;<br />
<span class="i4">"Signed,</span><br />
<span class="smcap i10">"Michael.</span>"</p>
</div>
<p class="p2">Our story has covered a period of thirteen years.
For eleven years more the genius of Scanderbeg,
which his perhaps too partial countrymen used to
compare to that of Alexander and Pyrrhus, withstood
the whole power of the Ottoman Empire, directed
against him by the most skilful generals of the age.
Sinam and Assem, Jusem and Caraza, Seremet and
the puissant Sultan Mahomet himself successively
appeared in the field; but retreated, leaving their thousands
of slain to attest the invincibility of the Albanian
chief. Only one Ottoman commander ventured
to return for a second campaign. The old Latin
chronicles of the monk Marinus Barletius&mdash;who records
the deeds of Castriot in thirteen volumes&mdash;assign
this honorable distinction to the Janizary, Ballaban
Badera. In six campaigns this redoubtable warrior
desolated Albania. From Thessaly, northward over
the land, poured the Moslem tide, but it stayed itself
at the waters of Skadar; and, as if fate had approved
the prophecy of the aged stranger at the nuptials of
Constantine and Morsinia, the castle of De Streeses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
during all these terrible years, looked down upon bloodless
fields. Though his lands were ravaged, the courage
of Castriot was not wearied, nor was his genius baffled,
until, in the year 1467, there came upon him a mightier
than Ballaban, a mightier than Mahomet. In the
presence of the last enemy he commended his country to
the valor of his voivodes, his family to the protection of
friends,<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and his soul to the grace of Jesu, his Saviour.
They buried him in the old church at Lyssa. Years
after, no Scanderbeg succeeding Scanderbeg, the
Turks possessed the land. They dug up his bones,
and, inclosing their fragments in silver and gold,
wore them as amulets. Pashas and Viziers esteemed
themselves happy, even in subsequent centuries, if
they might so much as touch a bone of Scanderbeg;
"For perchance," they said, "there may thus be
imparted to us some of that valor and skill which
in him were invincible by the might of men."</p>
